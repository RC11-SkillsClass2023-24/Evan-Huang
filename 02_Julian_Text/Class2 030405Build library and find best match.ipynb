Such was the promising state of my prospects when my evil genius brought to Madrid a native of Liege, Baron de Fraiture, chief huntsman of the principality, and a profligate, a gamester, and a cheat, like all those who proclaim their belief in his honesty nowadays.

The worthy Diego was sad at the thought of losing me, and could with difficulty refrain from tears. For some time my man Philippe continued to give me news of Donna Ignazia. She became the bride of a rich shoemaker, though her father was extremely mortified by her making a marriage so much beneath her station. I had promised the Marquis de las Moras and Colonel Royas that I would come and see them at Saragossa, the capital of Aragon, and I arrived there at the beginning of September.',\n",

They looked like dark phantoms more than men, for the cloak covered up at least half the face. Underneath the cloak was carried el Spadino, a sword of enormous length. Persons who wore this costume were treated with great respect, though they were mostly arrant rogues; still they might possibly be powerful noblemen in disguise. The visitor to Saragossa should see the devotion which is paid to our Lady del Pilar. I have seen processions going along the streets in which wooden statues of gigantic proportions were carried. I was taken to the best assemblies, where the monks swarmed. I was introduced to a lady of monstrous size, who, I was informed, was cousin to the famous Palafox, and I did not feel my bosom swell with pride as was evidently expected.',\n",

Nevertheless, he was held in great respect at Saragossa, for he was a monk, a canon, and an Inquisitor. The bull fights were finer at Saragossa than at Madrid—that is to say, they were deadlier; and the chief interest of this barbarous spectacle lies in the shedding of blood.

       " 'Chapter I I Make a Mistake and Manucci Becomes My Mortal Foe--his Vengeance--i Leave Madrid--saragossa--valentia--nina--i Arrive at Barcelona If these Memoirs, only written to console me in the dreadful weariness which is slowly killing me in Bohemia—and which, perhaps, would kill me anywhere, since, though my body is old, my spirit and my desires are as young as ever—if these Memoirs are ever read, I repeat, they will only be read when I am gone, and all censure will be lost on me. Nevertheless, seeing that men are divided into two sections, the one and by far the greater composed of the ignorant and superficial, and the other of the learned and reflective, I beg to state that it is to the latter I would appeal. Their judgment, I believe, will be in favour of my veracity, and, indeed, why should I not be veracious? A man can have no object in deceiving himself, and it is for myself that I chiefly write.',\n",
       " \"Hitherto I have spoken nothing but the truth, without considering whether the truth is in my favour or no. My book is not a work of dogmatic theology, but I do not think it will do harm to anyone; while I fancy that those who know how to imitate the bee and to get honey from every flower will be able to extract some good from the catalogue of my vices and virtues. After this digression (it may be too long, but that is my business and none other's), I must confess that never have I had so unpleasant a truth to set down as that which I am going to relate. I committed a fatal act of indiscretion—an act which after all these years still gives my heart a pang as I think of it. The day after my conquest I dined with the Venetian ambassador, and I had the pleasure of hearing that all the ministers and grandees with whom I had associated had the highest possible opinion of me.\",\n",
       " 'In three or four days the king, the royal family, and the ministers would return to town, and I expected to have daily conferences with the latter respecting the colony in the Sierra Morena, where I should most probably be going. Manucci, who continued to treat me as a valued friend, proposed to accompany me on my journey, and would bring with him an adventuress, who called herself Porto–Carrero, pretending to be the daughter or niece of the late cardinal of that name, and thus obtained a good deal of consideration; though in reality she was only the mistress of the French consul at Madrid, the Abbe Bigliardi. Such was the promising state of my prospects when my evil genius brought to Madrid a native of Liege, Baron de Fraiture, chief huntsman of the principality, and a profligate, a gamester, and a cheat, like all those who proclaim their belief in his honesty nowadays. I had unfortunately met him at Spa, and told him I was was going to Portugal.',\n",
       " 'He had come after me, hoping to use me as a means of getting into good society, and of filling his pocket with the money of the dupes he aspired to make. Gamesters have never had any proof of my belonging to their infernal clique, but they have always persisted in believing that I too am a \"Greek. \" As soon as this baron heard that I was in Madrid he called on me, and by dint of politeness obliged me to receive him. I thought any small civilities I might shew or introductions I might give could do me no harm. He had a travelling companion to whom he introduced me. He was a fat, ignorant fellow, but a Frenchman, and therefore agreeable. A Frenchman who knows how to present himself, who is well dressed, and has the society air, is usually accepted without demur or scrutiny. He had been a cavalry captain, but had been fortunate enough to obtain an everlasting furlough. Four or five days after his appearance the baron asked me quietly enough to lend him a score of louis, as he was hard up.',\n",
       " 'I replied as quietly, thanking him for treating me as a friend, but informing him that I really could not lend him the money, as I wanted what little I had for my own necessities. \"But we can do good business together, and you cannot possibly be moneyless. \" \"I do not know anything about good business, but I do know that I want my money and cannot part with it. \" \"We are at our wits\\' end to quiet our landlord; come and speak to him. \" \"If I were to do so I should do you more harm than good. He would ask me if I would answer for you, and I should reply that you are one of those noblemen who stand in need of no surety. All the same, the landlord would think that if I did not stand your surety, it must be from my entertaining doubts as to your solvency. \" I had introduced Fraiture to Count Manucci, on the Pando, and he requested me to take him to see the count, to which request I was foolish enough to accede. A few days later the baron opened his soul to Manucci.',\n",
       " 'He found the Venetian disposed to be obliging, but wary. He refused to lend money himself, but introduced the baron to someone who lent him money on pledges without interest. The baron and his friend did a little gaming and won a little money, but I held aloof from them to the best of my ability. I had my colony and Donna Ignazia, and wanted to live peacefully; and if I had spent a single night away from home, the innocent girl would have been filled with alarm. de Mocenigo went as ambassador to France, and was replaced by M. Querini was a man of letters, while Mocenigo only liked music and his own peculiar kind of love. The new ambassador was distinctly favourable to me, and in a few days I had reason to believe that he would do more for me than ever Mocenigo would have done. In the meanwhile, the baron and his friend began to think of beating a retreat to France.',\n",
       " 'There was no gaming at the ambassador\\'s and no gaming at the Court; they must return to France, but they owed money to their landlord, and they wanted money for the journey. I could give them nothing, Manucci would give them nothing; we both pitied them, but our duty to ourselves made us cruel to everyone else. One morning Manucci came to see me in evident perturbation. For the last week I have refused to see the Baron Fraiture, as not being able to give him money, his presence only wearied me. He has written me a letter, in which he threatens to blow out his brains to–day if I will not lend him a hundred pistoles. \" \"He said the same thing to me three days ago; but I replied that I would bet two hundred pistoles that he would do nothing of the kind. This made him angry, and he proposed to fight a duel with me; but I declined on the plea that as he was a desperate man either he would have an advantage over me or I, over him. Give him the same answer, or, better still, no answer at all.',\n",
       " '\" I admired his generosity and agreed to carry out his commission. I called on the baron, who seemed rather uncomfortable when I walked in; but considering his position I was not at all surprised. I informed him that I was the bearer of a thousand francs from Count Manucci, who thereby placed him in a position to arrange his affairs and to leave Madrid. He received the money without any signs of pleasure, surprise, or gratitude, and wrote out the receipt. He assured me that he and his friend would start for Barcelona and France on the following day. I then took the document to Manucci, who was evidently suffering from some mental trouble; and I remained to dinner with the ambassador. Three days after I went to dine with the ambassadors (for they all dined together), but to my astonishment the porter told me that he had received orders not to admit me. The effect of this sentence on me was like that of a thunderbolt; I returned home like a man in a dream.',\n",
       " 'I immediately sat down and wrote to Manucci, asking him why I had been subjected to such an insult; but Philippe, my man, brought me back the letter unopened. This was another surprise; I did not know what to expect next. \"I cannot imagine, but I will have an explanation, or perish. \" I dined sadly with Donna Ignazia, without telling her the cause of my trouble, and just as I was going to take my siesta a servant of Manucci\\'s brought me a letter from his master and fled before I could read it. The letter contained an enclosure which I read first. He asked Manucci to lend him a hundred pistoles, promising to shew him the man whom he held for his dearest friend to be his worst enemy. Manucci (honouring me, by the way, with the title of ungrateful traitor) said that the baron\\'s letter had excited his curiosity and he had met him in St.',\n",
       " \"Jerome's Park, where the baron had clearly proved this enemy to be myself, since I had informed the baron that though the name of Manucci was genuine the title of count was quite apocryphal. After recapitulating the information which Fraiture had given him, and which could only have proceeded from myself, he advised me to leave Madrid as soon as possible, in a week at latest. I can give the reader no idea of the shock this letter gave me. For the first time in my life I had to confess myself guilty of folly, ingratitude, and crime. I felt that my fault was beyond forgiveness, and did not think of asking Manucci to pardon me; I could do nothing but despair. Nevertheless, in spite of Manucci's just indignation, I could not help seeing that he had made a great mistake in advising me, in so insulting a manner, to leave Madrid in a week. The young man might have known that my self–respect would forbid my following such a piece of advice.\",\n",
       " 'He could not compel me to obey his counsel or command; and to leave Madrid would have been to commit a second baseness worse than the first. A prey to grief I spent the day without taking any steps one way or the other, and I went to bed without supping and without the company of Donna Ignazia. After a sound sleep I got up and wrote to the friend whom I had offended a sincere and humble confession of my fault. I concluded my letter by saying that I hoped that this evidence of my sincere and heartfelt repentance would suffice, but if not that I was ready to give him any honourable satisfaction in my power. \"You may,\" I said, \"have me assassinated if you like, but I shall not leave Madrid till its suits me to do so. \" I put a commonplace seal on my letter, and had the address written by Philippe, whose hand was unknown to Manucci, and then I sent it to Pando where the king had gone.',\n",
       " 'I kept my room the whole day; and Donna Ignazia, seeing that I had recovered my spirits to some degree, made no more enquiries about the cause of my distress. I waited in the whole of the next day, expecting a reply, but in vain. The third day, being Sunday, I went out to call on the Prince della Catolica. My carriage stopped at his door, but the porter came out and told me in a polite whisper that his highness had his reasons for not receiving me any longer. This was an unexpected blow, but after it I was prepared for anything. I drove to the Abbe Bigliardi, but the lackey, after taking in my name, informed me that his master was out. I got into my carriage and went to Varnier, who said he wanted to speak to me. \"Come into my carriage,\" said I, \"we will go and hear mass together. \" On our way he told me that the Venetian ambassador, Mocenigo, had warned the Duke of Medina Sidonia that I was a dangerous character.',\n",
       " '\"The duke,\" he added, \"replied that he would cease to know you as soon as he found out the badness of your character himself. \" These three shocks, following in such quick succession, cast me into a state of confusion. I said nothing till we heard mass together, but I believe that if I had not then told him the whole story I should have had an apoplectic fit. Varnier pitied me, and said,— \"Such are the ways of the great when they have abjured all virtue and honesty. Nevertheless, I advise you to keep silence about it, unless you would irritate Manucci still farther. \" When I got home I wrote to Manucci begging him to suspend his vengeance, or else I should be obliged to tell the story to all those who insulted me for the ambassador\\'s sake. Soderini, the secretary of the embassy, feeling sure that he would forward it to Manucci.',\n",
       " 'I dined with my mistress, and took her to the bull fight, where I chanced to find myself in a box adjoining that in which Manucci and the two ambassadors were seated. I made them a bow which they were obliged to return, and did not vouchsafe them another glance for the rest of the spectacle. The next day the Marquis Grimaldi refused to receive me, and I saw that I should have to abandon all hope. The Duke of Lossada remained my friend on account of his dislike to the ambassador and his unnatural tastes; but he told me that he had been requested not to receive me, and that he did not think I had the slightest chance of obtaining any employment at Court. I could scarcely believe in such an extremity of vengeance: Manucci was making a parade of the influence he possessed over his wife the ambassador. In his insane desire for revenge he had laid all shame aside.',\n",
       " 'I was curious to know whether he had forgotten Don Emmanuel de Roda and the Marquis de la Moras; I found both of them had been forewarned against me. There was still the Count of Aranda, and I was just going to see him when a servant of his highness\\'s came and told me that his master wished to see me. I shuddered, for in my then state of mind I drew the most sinister conclusions from the message. I found the great man alone, looking perfectly calm. He asked me to sit down—a favour he had not hitherto done me, and this further contributed to cheer me. \"What have you been doing to offend your ambassador?\" he began. \"My lord, I have done nothing to him directly, but by an inexcusable act of stupidity I have wounded his dear friend Manucci in his tenderest part. With the most innocent intentions I reposed my confidence in a cowardly fellow, who sold it to Manucci for a hundred pistoles. In his irritation, Manucci has stirred up the great man against me: \\'hinc illae lacrimae\\'.',\n",
       " 'I am sorry for you, because there is an end to all your hopes of advancement. The first thing the king would do would be to make enquiries about you of the ambassador. \" \"I feel it to my sorrow, my lord, but must I leave Madrid?\" \"No. The ambassador did his best to make me send you way, but I told him that I had no power over you so long as you did not infringe the laws. \" \"\\'He has calumniated a Venetian subject whom I am bound to protect,\\' said he. \"\\'In that case,\\' I replied, \\'you can resort to the ordinary law, and punish him to the best of your ability. \\'\" \"The ambassador finally begged me to order you not to mention the matter to any Venetian subjects at Madrid, and I think you can safely promise me this. \" \"My lord, I have much pleasure in giving your excellency my word of honour not to do so. Then you can stay at Madrid as long as you please; and, indeed, Mocenigo will be leaving in the course of a week.',\n",
       " '\" From that moment I made up my mind to amuse myself without any thought of obtaining a position in Spain. However, the ties of friendship made me keep up my acquaintance with Varnier, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, and the architect, Sabatini, who always gave me a warm welcome, as did his wife. Donna Ignazia had more of my company than ever, and congratulated me on my freedom from the cares of business. After the departure of Mocenigo I thought I would go and see if Querini, his nephew, was equally prejudiced against me. The porter told me that he had received orders not to admit me, and I laughed in the man\\'s face. Six or seven weeks after Manucci\\'s departure I, too, left Madrid. I did so on compulsion, in spite of my love for Ignazia, for I had no longer hopes of doing anything in Portugal, and my purse was nearly exhausted.',\n",
       " 'I thought of selling a handsome repeater and a gold snuff–box so as to enable me to go to Marseilles, whence I thought of going to Constantinople and trying my fortune there without turning renegade. Doubtless, I should have found the plan unsuccessful, for I was attaining an age when Fortune flies. I had no reason, however, to complain of Fortune, for she had been lavish in her gifts to me, and I in my turn had always abused them. In my state of distress the learned Abbe Pinzi introduced me to a Genoese bookseller, named Carrado, a thoroughly honest man, who seemed to have been created that the knavery of most of the Genoese might be pardoned. To him I brought my watch and snuff–box, but the worthy Carrado not only refused to buy them, but would not take them in pledge. He gave me seventeen hundred francs with no other security than my word that I would repay him if I were ever able to do so.',\n",
       " 'Unhappily I have never been able to repay this debt, unless my gratitude be accounted repayment. As nothing is sweeter than the companionship between a man and the woman he adores, so nothing is bitterer than the separation; the pleasure has vanished away, and only the pain remains. I spent my last days at Madrid drinking the cup of pleasure which was embittered by the thought of the pain that was to follow. The worthy Diego was sad at the thought of losing me, and could with difficulty refrain from tears. For some time my man Philippe continued to give me news of Donna Ignazia. She became the bride of a rich shoemaker, though her father was extremely mortified by her making a marriage so much beneath her station. I had promised the Marquis de las Moras and Colonel Royas that I would come and see them at Saragossa, the capital of Aragon, and I arrived there at the beginning of September.',\n",
       " 'My stay lasted for a fortnight, during which time I was able to examine the manners and customs of the Aragonese, who were not subject to the ordinances of the Marquis of Aranda, as long cloaks and low hats were to be seen at every corner. They looked like dark phantoms more than men, for the cloak covered up at least half the face. Underneath the cloak was carried el Spadino, a sword of enormous length. Persons who wore this costume were treated with great respect, though they were mostly arrant rogues; still they might possibly be powerful noblemen in disguise. The visitor to Saragossa should see the devotion which is paid to our Lady del Pilar. I have seen processions going along the streets in which wooden statues of gigantic proportions were carried. I was taken to the best assemblies, where the monks swarmed. I was introduced to a lady of monstrous size, who, I was informed, was cousin to the famous Palafox, and I did not feel my bosom swell with pride as was evidently expected.',\n",
       " 'I also made the acquaintance of Canon Pignatelli, a man of Italian origin. He was President of the Inquisition, and every morning he imprisoned the procuress who had furnished him with the girl with whom he had supped and slept. He would wake up in the morning tired out with the pleasures of the night; the girl would be driven away and the procuress imprisoned. He then dressed, confessed, said mass, and after an excellent breakfast with plenty of good wine he would send out for another girl, and this would go on day after day. Nevertheless, he was held in great respect at Saragossa, for he was a monk, a canon, and an Inquisitor. The bull fights were finer at Saragossa than at Madrid—that is to say, they were deadlier; and the chief interest of this barbarous spectacle lies in the shedding of blood. The Marquis de las Moras and Colonel Royas gave me some excellent dinners. The marquis was one of the pleasantest men I met in Spain; he died very young two years after.',\n",
       " 'The Church of Nuestra Senora del Pilar is situated on the ramparts of the town, and the Aragonese fondly believe this portion of the town defences to be impregnable. I had promised Donna Pelliccia to go and see her at Valentia, and on my way I saw the ancient town of Saguntum on a hill at some little distance. There was a priest travelling with me and I told him and the driver (who preferred his mules to all the antiquities in the world) that I should like to go and see the town. How the muleteer and the priest objected to this proposal! \"There are only ruins there, senor. \" The crown settled everything, and the man exclaimed, \"Valga me Dios, es un hombre de buen!\" (So help me God, this is an honest man!) A subject of his Catholic majesty knows no heartier praise than this. I saw the massive walls still standing and in good condition, and yet they were built during the second Punic War.',\n",
       " 'I saw on two of the gateways inscriptions which to me were meaningless, but which Seguier, the old friend of the Marquis Maffei, could no doubt have deciphered. The sight of this monument to the courage of an ancient race, who preferred to perish in the flames rather than surrender, excited my awe and admiration. The priest laughed at me, and I am sure he would not have purchased this venerable city of the dead if he could have done so by saying a mass. The very name has perished; instead of Saguntum it is called Murviedro from the Latin \\'muri veteres\\' (old walls); but Time that destroys marble and brass destroys also the very memory of what has been. \"This place,\" said the priest, \"is always called Murviedro. \" \"It is ridiculous to do so,\" I replied; \"common sense forbids us calling a thing old which was once young enough. That\\'s as if you would tell me that New Castille is really new. \" \"Well, Old Castille is more ancient than New Castille.',\n",
       " 'New Castille was only called so because it was the latest conquest; but as a matter of fact it is the older of the two. \" The poor priest took refuge in silence; shaking his head, and evidently taking me for a madman. I tried vainly to find Hannibal\\'s head, and the inscription in honour of Caesar Claudius, but I found out the remains of the amphitheatre. The next day I remarked the mosaic pavement, which had been discovered twenty years before. I reached Valentia at nine o\\'clock in the morning, and found that I should have to content myself with a bad lodging, as Marescalchi, the opera manager, had taken all the best rooms for the members of his company. Marescalchi was accompanied by his brother, a priest, whom I found decidedly learned for his age. We took a walk together, and he laughed when I proposed going into a cafe, for there was not such a thing in the town. There were only taverns of the lowest class where the wine is not fit to drink.',\n",
       " 'I could scarcely believe it, but Spain is a peculiar country. When I was at Valentia, a good bottle of wine was scarcely obtainable, though Malaga and Alicante were both close at hand. In the first three days of my stay at Valentia (the birthplace of Alexander VI. ), I saw all the objects of interest in the town, and was confirmed in my idea that what seems so admirable in the descriptions of writers and the pictures of artists loses much of its charm on actual inspection. Though Valentia is blessed with an excellent climate, though it is well watered, situated in the midst of a beautiful country, fertile in all the choicest products of nature, though it is the residence of many of the most distinguished of the Spanish nobility, though its women are the most handsome in Spain, though it has the advantage of being the seat of an archbishop; in spite of all these commodities, it is a most disagreeable town to live in.',\n",
       " \"One is ill lodged and ill fed, there is no good wine and no good company, there is not even any intellectual provision, for though there is a university, lettered men are absolutely unknown. As for the bridges, churches, the arsenal, the exchange, the town hall, the twelve town gates, and the rest, I could not take pleasure in a town where the streets are not paved, and where a public promenade is conspicuous by its absence. Outside the town the country is delightful, especially on the side towards the sea; but the outside is not the inside. The feature which pleased me most was the number of small one–horse vehicles which transport the traveller rapidly from one point to another, at a very slight expense, and will even undertake a two or three days' journey. If my frame of mind had been a more pleasant one, I should have travelled through the kingdoms of Murcia and Grenada, which surpass Italy in beauty and fertility.\",\n",
       " 'Poor Spaniards! This beauty and fertility of your land are the cause of your ignorance, as the mines of Peru and Potosi have brought about that foolish pride and all the prejudices which degrade you. Spaniards, when will the impulse come? when will you shake off that fatal lethargy? Now you are truly useless to yourselves, and the rest of the world; what is it you need? A furious revolution, a terrible shock, a conquest of regeneration; your case is past gentle methods, it needs the cautery and the fire. This was not a matter of any difficulty, as the same operas were to be presented as had been already played at Aranjuez, the Escurial, and the Granja, for the Count of Aranda would never have dared to sanction the performance of an Italian comic opera at Madrid. The novelty would have been too great, and the Inquisition would have interfered. The balls were a considerable shock, and two years after they were suppressed.',\n",
       " 'Spain will never make any real advance, until the Inquisition is suppressed also. As soon as Donna Pelliccia arrived, she sent in the letter of introduction she had received from the Duke of Arcos, three months before. She had not seen the duke since their meeting at Aranjuez. \"Madam,\" said Don Diego, the person to whom she was commended, \"I have come to offer you my services, and to tell you of the orders his grace has laid on me, of which you may possibly be ignorant. \" \"I hope, sir,\" she replied, \"that I am not putting you to any inconvenience, but I am extremely grateful to the duke and to yourself; and I shall have the honour of calling on you to give you my thanks. \" \"Not at all; I have only to say that I have orders to furnish you with any sums you may require, to the amount of twenty–five thousand doubloons. \" \"Twenty–five thousand doubloons?\" \"Exactly, madam, two hundred and fifty thousand francs in French money, and no more.',\n",
       " 'Kindly read his grace\\'s letter; you do not seem to be aware of its contents. \" The letter was a brief one: \"Don Diego,—You will furnish Donna Pelliccia with whatever sums she may require, not exceeding twenty–five thousand doubloons, at my account. \"THE DUKE DOS ARCOS\" We remained in a state of perfect stupefaction. Donna Pelliccia returned the epistle to the banker, who bowed and took his leave. This sounds almost incredible generosity, but in Spain such things are not uncommon. I have already mentioned the munificent gift of Medina– Celi to Madame Pichona. Those who are unacquainted with the peculiar Spanish character and the vast riches of some of the nobility, may pronounce such acts of generosity to be ridiculous and positively injurious, but they make a mistake. The spendthrift gives and squanders by a kind of instinct, and so he will continue to do as long as his means remain. But these splendid gifts I have described do not come under the category of senseless prodigality.',\n",
       " 'The Spaniard is chiefly ambitious of praise, for praise he will do anything; but this very desire for admiration serves to restrain him from actions by which he would incur blame. He wants to be thought superior to his fellows, as the Spanish nation is superior to all other nations; he wants to be thought worthy of a throne, and to be considered as the possessor of all the virtues. I may also note that while some of the Spanish nobility are as rich as the English lords, the former have not so many ways of spending their money as the latter, and thus are enabled to be heroically generous on occasion. As soon as Don Diego had gone, we began to discuss the duke\\'s noble behaviour. Donna Pelliccia maintained that the duke had wished to shew his confidence in her by doing her the honour of supposing her incapable of abusing his generosity; \"at all events,\" she concluded, \"I would rather die of hunger than take a single doubloon of Don Diego.',\n",
       " '\" \"The duke would be offended,\" said a violinist; \"I think you ought to take something. I was of the lady\\'s opinion, and told her that I was sure the duke would reward her delicacy by making her fortune. She followed my advice and her own impulse, though the banker remonstrated with her. Such is the perversity of the human mind that no one believed in Donna Pelliccia\\'s delicacy. When the king heard what had happened he ordered the worthy actress to leave Madrid, to prevent the duke ruining himself. Such is often the reward of virtue here below, but the malicious persons who had tried to injure Donna Pelliccia by calumniating her to the king were the means of making her fortune. The duke who had only spoken once or twice to the actress in public, and had never spent a penny on her, took the king\\'s command as an insult, and one not to be borne. He was too proud to solicit the king to revoke the order he had given, and in the end behaved in a way befitting so noble–minded a man.',\n",
       " 'For the first time he visited Donna Pelliccia at her own house, and begging her to forgive him for having been the innocent cause of her disgrace, asked her to accept a rouleau and a letter which he laid on the table. The rouleau contained a hundred gold ounces with the words \"for travelling expenses,\" and the letter was addressed to a Roman bank, and proved to be an order for twenty–four thousand Roman crowns. For twenty–nine years this worthy woman kept an establishment at Rome, and did so in a manner which proved her worthy of her good fortune. The day after Donna Pelliccia\\'s departure the king saw the Duke of Arcos, and told him not to be sad, but to forget the woman, who had been sent away for his own good. \"By sending her away, your majesty obliged me to turn fiction into fact, for I only knew her by speaking to her in various public places, and I had never made her the smallest present.',\n",
       " '\" \"Then you never gave her twenty–five thousand doubloons?\" \"Sire, I gave her double that sum, but only on the day before yesterday. Your majesty has absolute power, but if she had not received her dismissal I should never have gone to her house, nor should I have given her the smallest present. \" The king was stupefied and silent; he was probably meditating on the amount of credit a monarch should give to the gossip that his courtiers bring him. Monnino, who was afterwards known under the title of Castille de Florida Blanca, and is now living in exile in Murcia, his native country. After Marescalchi had gone, and I was making my preparations for my journey to Barcelona, I saw one day, at the bull fight, a woman whose appearance had a strange kind of fascination about it. There was a knight of Alcantara at my side, and I asked him who the lady was. \" \"How famous?\" \"If you do not know her story, it is too long to be told here.',\n",
       " '\" I could not help gazing at her, and two minutes later an ill–looking fellow beside her came up to my companion and whispered something in his ear. The knight turned towards me and informed me in the most polite manner that the lady whose name I had asked desired to know mine. I was silly enough to be flattered by her curiosity, and told the messenger that if the lady would allow me I would come to her box and tell her my name in person after the performance. \"From your accent I should suppose you were an Italian. \" When he had gone away my neighbour seemed inclined to be more communicative, and informed me that Nina was a dancer whom the Count de Ricla, the Viceroy of Barcelona, was keeping for some weeks at Valentia, till he could get her back to Barcelona, whence the bishop of the diocese had expelled her on account of the scandals to which she gave rise. \"The count,\" he added, \"is madly in love with her, and allows her fifty doubloons a day.',\n",
       " '\" \"She can\\'t do that, but she does not let a day pass without committing some expensive act of folly. \" I felt curious to know a woman of such a peculiar character, and longed for the end of the bull fight, little thinking in what trouble this new acquaintance would involve me. She received me with great politeness, and as she got into her carriage drawn by six mules, she said she would be delighted if I would breakfast with her at nine o\\'clock on the following day. Her house was just outside the town walls, and was a very large building. It was richly and tastefully furnished, and was surrounded by an enormous garden. The first thing that struck me was the number of the lackeys and the richness of their liveries, and the maids in elegant attire, who seemed to be going and coming in all directions. As I advanced I heard an imperious voice scolding some one. The scold was Nina, who was abusing an astonished–looking man, who was standing by a large table covered with stuffs and laces.',\n",
       " '\"Excuse me,\" said she, \"but this fool of a Spaniard wants to persuade me that this lace is really handsome. \" She asked me what I thought of the lace, and though I privately thought it lace of the finest quality, I did not care to contradict her, and so replied that I was no judge. \"Madam,\" said the tradesman, \"if you do not like the lace, leave it; will you keep the stuffs?\" \"Yes,\" she replied; \"and as for the lace, I will shew you that it is not the money that deters me. \" So saying the mad girl took up a pair of scissors and cut the lace into fragments. \"What a pity!\" said the man who had spoken to me at the bull fight. \" \"Be silent, you pimping rogue!\" said she, enforcing her words with a sturdy box on the ear. The fellow went off, calling her strumpet, which only made her scream with laughter; then, turning to the Spaniard, she told him to make out his account directly.',\n",
       " 'The man did not want telling twice, and avenged himself for the abuse he had received by the inordinate length of his bill. She took up the account and placed her initials at the bottom without deigning to look at the items, and said,— \"Go to Don Diego Valencia; he will pay you immediately. \" As soon as we were alone the chocolate was served, and she sent a message to the fellow whose ears she had boxed to come to breakfast directly. \"You needn\\'t be surprised at my way of treating him,\" she said. \"He\\'s a rascal whom Ricla has placed in my house to spy out my actions, and I treat him as you have seen, so that he may have plenty of news to write to his master. \" I thought I must be dreaming; such a woman seemed to me beyond the limits of the possible. The poor wretch, who came from Bologna and was a musician by profession, came and sat down with us without a word.',\n",
       " 'As soon as he had finished his breakfast he left the room, and Nina spent an hour with me talking about Spain, Italy, and Portugal, where she had married a dancer named Bergonzi. \"My father,\" she said, \"was the famous charlatan Pelandi; you may have known him at Venice. \" After this piece of confidence (and she did not seem at all ashamed of her parentage) she asked me to sup with her, supper being her favourite meal. I promised to come, and I left her to reflect on the extraordinary character of the woman, and on the good fortune which she so abused. Nina was wonderfully beautiful; but as it has always been my opinion that mere beauty does not go for much, I could not understand how a viceroy could have fallen in love with her to such an extent. As for Molinari, after which I had seen, I could only set him down as an infamous wretch. I went to supper with her for amusement\\'s sake, for, with all her beauty, she had not touched my heart in the slightest degree.',\n",
       " 'It was at the beginning of October, but at Valentia the thermometer marked twenty degrees Reaumur in the shade. Nina was walking in the garden with her companion, both of them being very lightly clad; indeed, Nina had only her chemise and a light petticoat. As soon as she saw me she came up and begged me to follow their example in the way of attire, but I begged to be excused. The presence of that hateful fellow revolted me in the highest degree. In the interval before supper Nina entertained me with a number of lascivious anecdotes of her experiences from the time she began her present mode of living up to the age of twenty–two, which was her age then. If it had not been for the presence of the disgusting Argus, no doubt all these stories would have produced their natural effect on me; but as it was they had none whatever. We had a delicate supper and ate with appetite, and after it was over I would have gladly left them; but Nina would not let me go.',\n",
       " \"The wine had taken effect, and she wished to have a little amusement. After all the servants had been dismissed, this Messalina ordered Molinari to strip naked, and she then began to treat him in a manner which I cannot describe without disgust. The rascal was young and strong, and, though he was drunk, Nina's treatment soon placed him in a hearty condition. I could see that she wished me to play my part in the revels, but my disgust had utterly deprived me of all my amorous faculties. Nina, too, had undressed, and seeing that I viewed the orgy coldly she proceeded to satiate her desires by means of Molinari. I had to bear with the sight of this beautiful woman coupling herself with an animal, whose only merit lay in his virile monstrosity, which she no doubt regarded as a beauty. When she had exhausted her amorous fury she threw herself into a bath, then came back, drank a bottle of Malmsey Madeira, and finally made her brutal lover drink till he fell on to the floor.\",\n",
       " 'I fled into the next room, not being able to bear it any longer, but she followed me. She was still naked, and seating herself beside me on an ottoman she asked me how I had enjoyed the spectacle. I told her boldy that the disgust with which her wretched companion had inspired me was so great that it had utterly annulled the effect of her charms. \"That may be so, but now he is not here, and yet you do nothing. \" \"You are right, for I have my feelings like any other man, but he has disgusted me too much. Wait till tomorrow, and let me not see that monster so unworthy of enjoying you. If I thought he did I would rather die than let him have to do with me, for I detest him. \" \"What! you do not love him, and yet you make use of him in the way you do?\" \"Yes, just as I might use a mechanical instrument. \" In this woman I saw an instance of the depths of degradation to which human nature may be brought.',\n",
       " 'She asked me to sup with her on the following day, telling me that we would be alone, as Molinari would be ill. \" \"You will not go for a week, and then we will go together. \" I went home with my mind made up to depart without having anything more to do with her; and though I was far from inexperienced in wickedness of all kinds, I could not help feeling astonished at the unblushing frankness of this Megaera, who had told me what I already knew, but in words that I had never heard a woman use before. \"I only use him to satisfy my desires, and because I am certain that he does not love me; if I thought he did I would rather die than allow him to do anything with me, for I detest him. \" The next day I went to her at seven o\\'clock in the evening. She received me with an air of feigned melancholy, saying,— \"Alas! we shall have to sup alone; Molinari has got the colic. \" \"You said he would be ill; have you poisoned him?\" \"I am quite capable of doing so, but I hope I never shall.',\n",
       " '\" \"But you have given him something?\" \"Only what he likes himself; but we will talk of that again. Let us sup and play till to–morrow, and tomorrow evening we will begin again. \" \"No, no, you are not; and your coachman will have no cause for complaint, for he has been paid; here is the receipt. \" These remarks, delivered with an air of amorous despotism, flattered my vanity. I made up my mind to submit gaily, called her wanton, and said I was not worth the pains she was taking over me. \"What astonishes me,\" said I, \"is that with this fine house you do not care to entertain company. \" \"Everybody is afraid to come; they fear Ricla\\'s jealousy, for it is well known that that animal who is now suffering from the colic tells him everything I do. He swears that it is not so, but I know him to be a liar. Indeed, I am very glad he does write to Ricla, and only wish he had something of real importance to write about. \" \"He will tell him that I have supped alone with you.',\n",
       " '\" \"All the better; are you afraid?\" \"No; but I think you ought to tell me if I have anything really to fear. \" \"But I should not like to involve you in a dispute which might be prejudicial to your interests. \" \"Not at all; the more I provoke him, the better he loves me, and I will make him pay dearly when he asks me to make it up. \" \"Then you don\\'t love him?\" \"Yes, to ruin him; but he is so rich that there doesn\\'t seem much hope of my ever doing that. \" Before me I saw a woman as beautiful as Venus and as degraded as Lucifer; a woman most surely born to be the ruin of anyone who had the misfortune to fall in love with her. I had known women of similar character, but never one so dangerous as she. I determined to make some money out of her if I could. She called for cards, and asked me to play with her at a game called primiera. It is a game of chance, but of so complicated a nature that the best player always wins.',\n",
       " 'In a quarter of an hour I found that I was the better player, but she had such luck that at the end of the game I had lost twenty pistoles, which I paid on the spot. She took the money, promising to give me my revenge. We had supper, and then we committed all the wantonness she wished and I was capable of performing, for with me the age of miracles was past. The next day I called to see her earlier in the evening. We played again; and she lost, and went on losing evening after evening, till I had won a matter of two or three hundred doubloons, no unwelcome addition to my somewhat depleted purse. The spy recovered from his colic and supped with us every evening, but his presence no longer interfered with my pleasure since Nina had ceased to prostitute herself to him in my presence. She did the opposite; giving herself to me, and telling him to write to the Comte de Ricla whatever he liked. The count wrote her a letter which she gave me to read.',\n",
       " \"The poor love– sick viceroy informed her that she might safely return to Barcelona, as the bishop had received an order from the Court to regard her as merely au actress, whose stay in his diocese would only be temporary; she would thus be allowed to live there in peace so long as she abstained from giving cause for scandal. She told me that whilst she was at Barcelona I could only see her after ten o'clock at night, when the count always left her. Possibly I should not have stayed at Barcelona at all if Nina had not told me that she would always be ready to lend me as much money as I wanted. She asked me to leave Valentia a day before her, and to await her at Tarragona. I did so, and spent a very pleasant day in that town, which abounds in remains of antiquity. I ordered a choice supper according to her instructions, and took care that she should have a separate bedroom so as to avoid any scandal.\",\n",
       " 'She started in the morning begging me to wait till the evening, and to travel by night so as to reach Barcelona by day–time. She told me to put up at the \"Santa Maria,\" and not to call till I had heard from her. I followed all the directions given me by this curious woman, and found myself comfortably lodged at Barcelona. My landlord was a Swiss who told me in confidence that he had received instructions to treat me well, and that I had only to ask for what I wanted.',\n",
       " \"Chapter II My Imprudence--passano--I Am Imprisoned--my Departure From Barcelona-- Madame Castelbajac at Montpellier--nimes--i Arrive at Aix Although my Swiss landlord seemed an honest and trustworthy kind of man, I could not help thinking that Nina had acted very imprudently in commending me to him. She was the viceroy's mistress; and though the viceroy might be a very agreeable man, he was a Spaniard, and not likely to be easy–going in his love affairs. Nina herself had told me that he was ardent, jealous, and suspicious. But the mischief was done, and there was no help for it. When I got up my landlord brought me a valet de place, for whose character he said he could answer, and he then sent up an excellent dinner. After dinner I summoned my host, and asked him whether Nina had told him to get me a servant. He answered in the affirmative, and added that a carriage was awaiting my commands at the door; it had been taken by the week.\",\n",
       " '\"I am astonished to hear it, for no one but myself can say what I can afford or not. \" \"Paid for! I will not have it!\" \"You can settle that with her, but I shall certainly take no payment. \" I saw dangers ahead, but as I have never cared to cherish forbodings I dismissed the idea. I had a letter of introduction from the Marquis de las Moras to Don Miguel de Cevallos, and another from Colonel Royas to Don Diego de la Secada. I took my letters, and the next day Don Diego came to see me, and took me to the Comte de Peralda. The day after Don Miguel introduced me to the Comte de Ricla, Viceroy of Catalonia, and the lover of Nina. The Comte de Peralada was a young man with a pleasant face but with an ill–proportioned body. He was a great debauchee and lover of bad company, an enemy of religion, morality, and law. He was directly descended from the Comte de Peralada, who served Philip II. so well that this king declared him \"count by the grace of God.',\n",
       " '\" The original patent of nobility was the first thing I saw in his antechamber, where it was framed and glazed so that all visitors might see it in the quarter of an hour they were kept waiting. The count received me with an easy and cordiale manner, which seemed to say that he renounced all the dignities of his rank. He thanked Don Diego for introducing me, and talked a good deal about Colonel Royas. He asked me if I had seen the English girl he was keeping at Saragossa, and on my replying in the affirmative, he told me in a whisper that he had slept with her. He took me to his stables, where he had some splendid horses, and then asked me to dine with him the next day.',\n",
       " \"The viceroy received me in a very different manner; he stood up so that he might not have to offer me a chair, and though I spoke Italian, with which language I knew him to be well acquainted, he answered me in Spanish, styling me 'ussia' (a contraction of 'vuestra senoria', your lordship, and used by everyone in Spain), while I gave him his proper title of excellence. He talked a good deal about Madrid, and complained that M. de Mocenigo had gone to Paris by Bayonne instead of Barcelona, as he had promised him. I tried to excuse my ambassador by saying that by taking the other route he had saved fifty leagues of his journey, but the viceroy replied that 'tenir la palabra' (keeping to one's words) comes before all else. He asked me if I thought of staying long at Barcelona, and seemed surprised when I told him that, with his leave, I hoped to make a long stay.\",\n",
       " '\"I hope you will enjoy yourself,\" he said, \"but I must warn you that if you indulge in the pleasures which my nephew Peralada will doubtless offer you, you will not enjoy a very good reputation at Barcelona. \" As the Comte de Ricla made this observation in public, I thought myself justified in communicating it to Peralada himself. He was delighted, and told me, with evident vanity, that he had gone to Madrid three times, and had been ordered to return to Catalonia on each occasion. I thought my best plan would be to follow the viceroy\\'s indirect advice, so I refused to join in any of the little parties of pleasure which Peralada proposed. On the fifth day after my arrival, an officer came to ask me to dinner at the viceroy\\'s. I accepted the invitation with much pleasure, for I had been afraid of the viceroy\\'s having heard of my relations with Nina, and thought it possible that he might have taken a dislike to me.',\n",
       " \"He was very pleasant to me at dinner, often addressing his observations to me, but always in a tone of great gravity. I had been in Barcelona for a week, and was beginning to wonder why I had not heard from Nina; but one evening she wrote me a note, begging me to come on foot and alone to her house at ten o'clock the same night. If I had been wise I should not have gone, for I was not in love with the woman, and should have remembered the respect due to the viceroy; but I was devoid of all wisdom and prudence. All the misfortunes I have experienced in my long life never taught me those two most necessary virtues. At the hour she had named I called on her, wearing my great coat, and with a sword for my only weapon. I found Nina with her sister, a woman of thirty–six or thereabouts, who was married to an Italian dancer, nicknamed Schizza, because he had a flatter nose than any Tartar.\",\n",
       " 'Nina had just been supping with her lover, who had left her at ten o\\'clock, according to his invariable custom. She said she was delighted to hear I had been to dinner with him, as she had herself spoken to him in my praise, saying how admirably I had kept her company at Valentia. \"I am glad to hear it, but I do not think you are wise in inviting me to your house at such late hours. \" \"I only do so to avoid scandal amongst my neighbours. \" \"In my opinion my coming so late is only likely to increase the probability of scandal, and to make your viceroy jealous. \" I went away at midnight, after a conversation of the most decent character. Her sister did not leave us for a moment, and Nina gave her no cause to suspect the intimacy of our relations. I went to see her every evening, without encroaching on the count\\'s preserves. I thought myself secure, but the following warning should have made me desist if I had not been carried away by the forces of destiny and obstinacy in combination.',\n",
       " 'An officer in the Walloon Guards accosted me one day as I was walking by myself just outside the town. He begged me in the most polite manner to excuse him if he spoke on a matter which was indifferent to him but of great consequence to me. \"Speak, sir,\" I replied, \"I will take whatever you say in good part. You are a stranger, sir, and may not be acquainted with our Spanish manners, consequently you are unaware of the great risk you run in going to see Nina every evening after the count has left her. \" \"What risk do I run? I have no doubt that the count knows all about it and does not object. \" \"I have no doubt as to his knowing it, and he may possibly pretend to know nothing before her, as he fears as well as loves her; but if she tells you that he does not object, she either deceives herself or you. He cannot love her without being jealous, and a jealous Spaniard … \"Follow my advice, sir, and forgive my freedom.',\n",
       " '\" \"I am sincerely obliged to you for your kind interest in me, but I cannot follow your advice, as by doing so I should be wanting in politeness to Nina, who likes to see me and gives me a warm welcome. I shall continue to visit her till she orders me not to do so, or till the count signifies to me his displeasure at my visits to his mistress. \" \"The count will never do such a thing; he is too careful of his dignity. \" The worthy officer then narrated to me all the acts of injustice which Ricla had committed since he had fallen in love with this woman. He had dismissed gentlemen from his service on the mere suspicion that they were in love with her; some had been exiled, and others imprisoned on one frivolous pretext or another. Before he had known Nina he had been a pattern of wisdom, justice, and virtue, and now he had become unjust, cruel, blindly passionate, and in every way a scandal to the high position he occupied.',\n",
       " 'All this should have influenced me, but it had not the slightest effect. I told him for politeness\\' sake that I would endeavour to part from her by degrees, but I had no intention of doing so. When I asked him how he knew that I visited Nina, he laughed and said it was a common topic of conversation all over the town. The same evening I called on her without mentioning my conversation with the officer. There would have been some excuse for me if I had been in love with her, but as it was … I acted like a madman. On the 14th of November I went to see her at the usual time. I found her with a man who was shewing her miniatures. I looked at him and found that he was the scoundrel Passano, or Pogomas. My blood boiled; I took Nina\\'s hand and led her into a neighbouring room, and told her to dismiss the rogue at once, or I would go to return no more. \" \"I am well acquainted with his history, and will tell you all about it presently; but send him away, or I shall go.',\n",
       " '\" She called her sister, and told her to order the Genoese to leave the house and never to enter it again. The thing was \\'done in a moment, but the sister told us that as he went out he had said,— \"Se ne pentira. I occupied an hour in relating some of the injuries I had received from this scoundrelly fellow. The next day (November 15th), I went to Nina at the usual time, and after spending two hours in pleasant converse with her and her sister I went out as the clocks were striking midnight. The door of the house was under an arcade, which extended to the end of the street. It was a dark night; and I had scarcely gone twenty–five paces when two men suddenly rushed at me. I stepped back, drawing my sword, and exclaiming, \"Assassins!\" and then with a rapid movement, I thrust my blade into the body of the nearest assailant. I then left the arcade, and began to run down the street. The second assassin fired a pistol at me, but it fortunately missed me.',\n",
       " 'I fell down and dropped my hat in my rapid flight, and got up and continued my course without troubling to pick it up. I did not know whether I was wounded or not, but at last I got to my inn, and laid down the bloody sword on the counter, under the landlord\\'s nose. I told the landlord what had happened, and on taking off my great coat, I found it to be pierced in two places just below the armpit. \"I am going to bed,\" I said to the landlord, \"and I leave my great coat and the sword in your charge. Tomorrow morning I shall ask you to come with me before the magistrate to denounce this act of assassination, for if the man was killed it must be shewn that I only slew him to save my own life. \" \"I think your best plan would be to fly Barcelona immediately. \" \"Then you think I have not told you the strict truth?\" \"I am sure you have; but I know whence the blow comes, and God knows what will befall you!\" \"Nothing at all; but if I fly I shall be accounted guilty.',\n",
       " 'Take care of the sword; they tried to assassinate me, but I think the assassins got the worst of it. \" I went to bed somewhat perturbed, but I had the consoling thought that if I had killed a man I had done so to self–defence; my conscience was quite clear. At seven o\\'clock the next morning I heard a knocking at my door. I opened it, and saw my landlord, accompanied by an officer, who told me to give him all my papers, to dress, and to follow him, adding that he should be compelled to use force in case of resistance. \"By whose authority do you ask me for my papers?\" \"By the authority of the governor. They will be returned to you if nothing suspicious is found amongst them. \" \"Where are you going to take me?\" \"To the citadel. \" I opened my trunk, took out my linen and my clothes, which I gave to my landlord, and I saw the officer\\'s astonishment at seeing my trunk half filled with papers. \"I advise you, sir,\" he said, \"to put all necessary articles into a portmanteau.',\n",
       " '\" He then ordered the landlord to send me a bed, and finally asked me if I had any papers in my pockets. \" \"That\\'s exactly what we want,\" he rejoined, with a grim smile. \"My passports are sacred; I will never give them to anyone but the governor–general. Reverence your king; here is his passport, here is that of the Count of Aranda, and here the passport of the Venetian ambassador. You will have to bind me hand and foot before you get them. In giving them to me it is just as if you gave them to the viceroy. If you resist I will not bind you hand and foot, but I shall take you before the viceroy, and then you will be forced to give them up in public. Give them to me with a good grace, and you shall have an acknowledgement. \" The worthy landlord told me I should be wiser to give in, so I let myself be persuaded. The officer gave me a full quittance, which I put in my pocketbook (this he let me keep out of his kindness), and then I followed him.',\n",
       " 'He had six constables with him, but they kept a good distance away. Comparing this with the circumstances of my arrest at Madrid, I thought myself well treated. Before we left the inn the officer told me that I might order what meals I pleased, and I asked the landlord to let me have my dinner and supper as usual. On the way I told him of my adventure of the night before; he listened attentively but made no comments. When we reached the citadel I was delivered to the officer of the guard, who gave me a room on the first floor. It was bare of furniture, but the windows looked on to a square and had no iron bars. I had scarcely been there ten minutes when my carpet bag and an excellent bed were brought in. As soon as I was alone I began to think over the situation. \"What can this imprisonment have to do with my last night\\'s adventure?\" I reflected.',\n",
       " '\"They are bent on examining my papers; they must think I have been tampering in some political or religious intrigue; but my mind is quite at ease on that score. I am well lodged at present, and no doubt shall be set free after my papers have been examined; they can find nothing against me there. \"The affair of my attempted assassination will, no doubt, be considered separately. \"Even if the rascal is dead, I do not see what they can do to me. \"On the other hand, my landlord\\'s advice to fly from Barcelona looks ominous; what if the assassins received their orders from some person high in authority? \"It is possible that Ricla may have vowed my ruin, but it does not seem probable to me. \"Would it have been wise to follow the landlord\\'s advice? \"Possibly, but I do not think so; my honour would have suffered, and I might have been caught and laid up in some horrid dungeon, whereas for a prison I am comfortable enough here.',\n",
       " '\"In three or four days the examination of my papers will have been completed, and as there is nothing in them likely to be offensive to the powers that be, they will be returned to me with my liberty, which will taste all the sweeter for this short deprivation. \"I cannot think that the all–powerful hand of the viceroy could have directed the assassin\\'s sword; it would be a dishonour to him, and if it were so, he would not be treating me so kindly now. If it were his doing, he must have heard directly that the blow had failed, and in that case I do not think he would have arrested me this morning. \"Shall I write to Nina? Will writing be allowed here?\" As I was puzzling my brains with these reflections, stretched on my bed (for I had no chair), I heard some disturbance, and on opening my window I saw, to my great astonishment, Passano being brought into the prison by a corporal and two soldiers. As he was going in, the rascal looked up and saw me, and began to laugh.',\n",
       " '\"Alas!\" I said to myself, \"here is fresh food for conjecture. The fellow told Nina\\'s sister that I should be sorry for what I had done. He must have directed some fearful calumny against me, and they are imprisoning him so as to be sure of his evidence. \" On reflection, I was well pleased at the turn affairs had taken. An excellent dinner was set before me, but I had no chair or table. The deficiency was remedied by the soldier who was in charge of me for the consideration of a duro. Prisoners were not allowed to have pen and ink without special permission; but paper and pencils were not included under this regulation, so my guard got them for me, together with candles and candlesticks, and I proceeded to kill time by making geometrical calculations. I made the obliging soldier sup with me, and he promised to commend me to one of his comrades who would serve me well.',\n",
       " 'On the fourth day the officer of the guard came to me with a distressed look, and told me that he had the disagreeable duty of giving me some very bad news. \"What is that, sir?\" \"I have received orders to transfer you to the bottom of the tower. \" \"Then they must have discovered in me a criminal of the deepest dye! Let us go at once. \" I found myself in a kind of round cellar, paved with large flagstones, and lighted by five or six narrow slits in the walls. The officer told me I must order what food required to be brought once a day, as no one was allowed to come into the \\'calabozo\\', or dungeon, by night. \"How about lights?\" \"You may lave one lamp always burning, and that will be enough, as books are not allowed. When your dinner is brought, the officer on duty will open the pies and the poultry to see that they do not contain any documents; for here no letters are allowed to come in or go out. \" \"Have these orders been given for my especial benefit?\" \"No, sir; it is the ordinary rule.',\n",
       " '\" \"How about the cleanliness of my cell?\" \"A soldier will accompany the officer in charge of your dinner, and he will attend to your wants for a trifle. \" \"May I amuse myself by making architectural plans with the pencil?\" \"As much as you like. \" \"Then will you be good enough to order some paper to be bought for me?\" \"With pleasure. \" The officer seemed to pity me as he left me, and bolted and barred the heavy door behind which I saw a man standing sentry with his bayonet fixed. When I got my paper and my dinner at noonday the officer cut open a fowl, and plunged a fork in the other dishes so as to make sure that there were no papers at the bottom. I told the officer that I should be much honoured by his dining with me, but he replied that it was strictly forbidden. He gave me the same answer when I asked if I might have the newspapers.',\n",
       " 'It was a festival time for the sentinels, as I shared my meals and my good wine with them; and consequently these poor fellows were firmly attached to me. I was curious to know who was paying for my good cheer, but there was no chance of my finding out, for the waiter from the inn was never allowed to approach my cell. In this dungeon, where I was imprisoned for forty–two days, I wrote in pencil and without other reference than my memory, my refutation of Amelot de la Houssaye\\'s \"History of the Venetian Government. \" I was most heartily amused during my imprisonment, and in the following manner: While I was at Warsaw an Italian named Tadini came to Warsaw. He had an introduction to Tomatis who commended him to me. Tomatis used to give him a dinner now and again, but not being well off in those days I could only give him good words and a cup of coffee when he chanced to come about my breakfast–time.',\n",
       " 'Tadini talked to everybody about the operations he had performed, and condemned an oculist who had been at Warsaw for twenty years, saying that he did not understand how to extract a cataract, while the other oculist said that Tadini was a charlatan who did not know how the eye was made. Tadini begged me to speak in his favour to a lady who had had a cataract removed by the Warsaw oculist, only to return again a short time after the operation. The lady was blind of the one eye, but she could see with the other, and I told Tadini that I did not care to meddle with such a delicate matter. \"I have spoken to the lady,\" said Tadini, \"and I have mentioned your name as a person who will answer for me. \" \"You have done wrong; in such a matter I would not stand surety for the most learned of men, and I know nothing about your learning. \" \"I know you were introduced to me as such, but that\\'s all.',\n",
       " 'As a professional man, you should not need anyone\\'s commendation, you should be able to say, \\'Operibus credite\\'. \" Tadini was vexed with my incredulity, and shewed me a number of testimonials, which I might possibly have read, if the first which met my eye had not been from a lady who protested to all and singular that M. At this I laughed in his face and told him to leave me alone. A few days after I found myself dining with him at the house of the lady with the cataract. She had almost made up her mind to submit to the operation, but as the rascal had mentioned my name, she wanted me to be present at a dispute between Tadini and the other oculist who came in with the dessert. I disposed myself to listen to the arguments of the two rival professors with considerable pleasure. The Warsaw oculist was a German, but spoke French very well; however, he attacked Tadini in Latin.',\n",
       " 'The Italian checked him by saying that their discourse must be conducted in a language intelligible to the lady, and I agreed with him. It was plain that Tadini did not know a word of Latin. The German oculist began by admitting that after the operation for cataract there was no chance of the disease returning, but that there was a considerable risk of the crystalline humour evaporating, and the patient being left in a state of total blindness. Tadini, instead of denying this statement (which was inaccurate), had the folly to take a little box out of his pocket. \"A substance which I can place in the cornea to supply the loss of the crystalline matter. \" The German went off into a roar of laughter so long and loud that the lady could not help laughing. I should have liked to join them, but I was ashamed to be thought the patron of this ignorant fellow, so I preserved a gloomy silence.',\n",
       " 'Tadini no doubt interpreted my silence as a mark of disapproval of the German\\'s laughter, and thought to better matters by asking me to give my opinion. \" \"There\\'s a great difference between a tooth and the crystalline humour; and though you may have succeeded in putting an artificial tooth into a gum, this treatment will not do with the eye. \" At this the ignorant rascal got up and left the room, and it was decidedly the best thing he could do. We laughed over this new treatment, and the lady promised to have nothing more to do with him. The professor was not content to despise his opponent in silence. He had him cited before the Faculty of Medicine to be examined on his knowledge of the eye, and procured the insertion of a satiric article in the news on the new operation for replacing the crystalline humour, alluding to the wonderful artist then in Warsaw who could perform this operation as easily as a dentist could put in a false tooth.',\n",
       " 'This made Tadini furious, and he set upon the old professor in the street and forced him to the refuge in a house. After this he no doubt left the town on foot, for he was seen no more. Now the reader is in a position to understand my surprise and amusement, when, one day as I peered through the grating in my dungeon, I saw the oculist Tadini standing over me with gun in hand. But he at all events evinced no amusement whatever, while I roared and roared again with laughter for the two hours his duty lasted. I gave him a good meal and a sufficiency of my excellent wine, and at the end a crown, promising that he should have the same treatment every time he returned to the post. But I only saw him four times, as the guard at my cell was a position eagerly coveted and intrigued for by the other soldiers. He amused me by the story of his misadventures since he had left Warsaw.',\n",
       " 'He had travelled far and wide without making a fortune, and at last arrived in Barcelona, where he failed to meet with any courtesy or consideration. He had no introduction, no diploma; he had refused to submit to an examination in the Latin tongue, because (as he said) there was no connection between the learned languages and the diseases of the eye; and the result was that, instead of the common fate of being ordered to leave the country, he was made into a soldier. He told me in confidence that he intended to desert, but he said he should take care to avoid the galleys. \"What have you done with your crystals?\" \"I have renounced them since I left Warsaw, though I am sure they would succeed. On December 28th, six weeks after my arrest, the officer of the guard came to my cell and told me to dress and follow him. \"Where are we going?\" \"I am about to deliver you to an officer of the viceroy, who is waiting.',\n",
       " '\" I dressed hastily, and after placing all my belongings in a portmanteau I followed him. We went to the guardroom, and there I was placed under the charge of the officer who had arrested me, who took me to the palace. There a Government official shewed me my trunk, telling me that I should find all my papers intact; and he then returned me my three passports, with the remark that they were genuine documents. \" \"I suppose so, but we had reasons for doubting their authenticity. \" \"They must have been strange reasons, for, as you now confess, these reasons were devoid of reason. \" \"You must be aware that I cannot reply to such an objection. \" \"Your character is perfectly clear; all the same I must request you to leave Barcelona in three days, and Catalonia in a week. \" \"Of course I will obey; but it strikes me that the Catalonian method of repairing injustice is somewhat peculiar. \" \"If you think you have ground for complaint you are at liberty to go to Madrid and complain to the Court.',\n",
       " '\" \"I have certainly grounds enough for complaint, sir, but I shall go to France, and not to Madrid; I have had enough of Spanish justice. Will you please give me the order to leave in writing?\" \"That\\'s unnecessary; you may take it for granted. My name is Emmanuel Badillo; I am a secretary of state. That gentleman will escort you back to the room where you were arrested. To–morrow I will send you your passport, signed by the viceroy and myself. \" Accompanied by the officer and a servant bearing my portmanteau, I proceeded to my old inn. On my way I saw a theatrical poster, and decided to go to the opera. The good landlord was delighted to see me again, and hastened to light me a fire, for a bitterly cold north wind was blowing. He assured me that no one but himself had been in my room, and in the officer\\'s presence he gave me back my sword, my great coat, and, to my astonishment, the hat I had dropped in my flight from the assassins.',\n",
       " 'The officer asked me if I had any complaints to make, and I replied that I had none. \"I should like to hear you say that I had done nothing but my duty, and that personally I have not done you any injury. \"Farewell, sir,\" said he, \"I hope you will have a pleasant journey. \" I told my landlord that I would dine at noon, and that I trusted to him to celebrate my liberation in a fitting manner, and then I went to the post office to see if there were any letters for me. I found five or six letters, with the seals intact, much to my astonishment. What is one to make of a Government which deprives a man of his liberty on some trifling pretext, and, though seizing all his papers, respects the privacy of his letters? But Spain, as I have remarked, is peculiar in every way. These letters were from Paris, Venice, Warsaw, and Madrid, and I have never had any reason to believe that any other letters had come for me during my imprisonment.',\n",
       " 'I went back to my inn, and asked my landlord to bring the bill. Here is your bill for the period preceding your imprisonment, and, as you see, it has been settled. I also received orders from the same source to provide for you during your imprisonment, and as long as you stayed at Barcelona. \" \"Did you know how long I should remain in prison?\" \"No, I was paid by the week. \" \"What has become of the valet de place?\" \"I paid him, and sent him away immediately after your arrest. \" \"I should like to have him with me as far as Perpignan. \" \"You are right, and I think the best thing you can do is to leave Spain altogether, for you will find no justice in it. \" \"What do they say about my assassination?\" \"Why, they say you fired the shot that people heard yourself, and that you made your own sword bloody, for no one was found there, either dead or wounded. Where did my hat come from?\" \"It was brought to me three days after.',\n",
       " '\" \"What a confusion! But was it known that I was imprisoned in the tower?\" \"Everybody knew it, and two good reasons were given, the one in public, and the other in private. \" \"What are these reasons?\" \"The public reason was that you had forged your passports; the private one, which was only whispered at the ear, was that you spent all your nights with Nina. \" \"You might have sworn that I never slept out of your inn. \" \"I told everyone as much, but no matter; you did go to her house, and for a certain nobleman that\\'s a crime. I am glad you did not fly as I advised you, for as it is your character is cleared before everybody. \" \"I should like to go to the opera this evening; take me a box. \" \"It shall be done; but do not have anything more to do with Nina, I entreat you. \" \"No, my good friend, I have made up my mind to see her no more. \" Just as I was sitting down to dinner, a banker\\'s clerk brought me a letter which pleased me very much.',\n",
       " 'It contained the bills of exchange I had drawn in Genoa, in favour of M. He now sent them back, with these words: \"Passano has been vainly endeavouring to persuade me to send these bills to Barcelona, so that they may be protested, and you arrested. I now send them to you to convince you that I am not one of those who delight in trampling down the victims of bad fortune. \" For the fourth time a Genoese had behaved most generously to me. I was almost persuaded that I ought to forgive the infamous Passano for the sake of his four excellent fellow–countrymen. I concluded that the best thing I could do would be to rid the Genoese name of the opprobrium which this rascal was always bringing on it, but I could never find an opportunity. Some years after I heard that the wretch died in miserable poverty in Genoa. I was curious at the time to know what had become of him, as it was important for me to be on my guard.',\n",
       " \"I confided my curiosity to my landlord, and he instructed one of the servants to make enquiries. I only heard the following circumstance: Ascanio Pogomas, or Passano, had been released at the end of November, and had then been embarked on a felucca bound for Toulon. The same day I wrote a long and grateful letter to M. I had indeed reason to be grateful, for if he had listened to my enemy he might have reduced me to a state of dreadful misery. My landlord had taken the box at the opera in my name, and two hours afterwards, to everyone's great astonishment, the posters announcing the plays of the evening were covered by bills informing the public that two of the performers had been taken ill, that the play would not be given, and the theatre closed till the second day of the new year. This order undoubtedly came from the viceroy, and everybody knew the reason.\",\n",
       " \"I was sorry to have deprived the people of Barcelona of the only amusement they had in the evening, and resolved to stay indoors, thinking that would be the most dignified course I could adopt. Petrarch says,— 'Amor che fa gentile un cor villano'. If he had known the lover of Nina he would have changed the line into 'Amor che fa villan un cor gentile'. In four months I shall be able to throw some more light on this strange business. I should have left Barcelona the same day, but a slight tinge of superstition made me desire to leave on the last day of the unhappy year I had spent in Spain. I therefore spent my three days of grace in writing letters to all my friends. Don Miguel de Cevallos, Don Diego de la Secada, and the Comte de la Peralada came to see me, but separately. Don Diego de la Secada was the uncle of the Countess A― B― whom I had met at Milan. These gentlemen told me a tale as strange as any of the circumstances which had happened to me at Barcelona.\",\n",
       " \"On the 26th of December the Abbe Marquisio, the envoy of the Duke of Modena, asked the viceroy, before a considerable number of people, if he could pay me a visit, to give me a letter which he could place in no hands but mine. If not he said he should be obliged to take the letter to Madrid, for which town he was obliged to set out the next day. The count made no answer, to everyone's astonishment, and the abbe left for Madrid the next day, the eve of my being set at liberty. I wrote to the abbe, who was unknown to me, but I never succeeded in finding out the truth about this letter. There could be no doubt that I had been arrested by the despotic viceroy, who had been persuaded by Nina that I was her favoured lover. The question of my passports must have been a mere pretext, for eight or ten days would have sufficed to send them to Madrid and have them back again if their authenticity had been doubted.\",\n",
       " 'Possibly Passano might have told the viceroy that any passports of mine were bound to be false, as I should have had to obtain the signature of my own ambassador. This, he might have said, was out of the question as I was in disgrace with the Venetian Government. As a matter of fact, he was mistaken if he really said so, but the mistake would have been an excusable one. When I made up my mind at the end of August to leave Madrid, I asked the Count of Aranda for a passport. He replied that I must first obtain one from my ambassador, who, he added, could not refuse to do me this service. Fortified with this opinion I called at the embassy. Querini was at San Ildefonso at the time, and I told the porter that I wanted to speak to the secretary of embassy. The servant sent in my name, and the fop gave himself airs, and pretended that he could not receive me.',\n",
       " 'In my indignation I wrote to him saying that I had not called to pay my court to the secretary, but to demand a passport which was my right. I gave my name and my degree (doctor of law), and begged him to leave the passport with the porter, as I should call for it on the following day. I presented myself accordingly, and the porter told me that the ambassador had left verbal orders that I was not to have a passport. I wrote immediately to the Marquis Grimaldi and to the Duke of Lossada, begging them to request the ambassador to send me a passport in the usual form, or else I should publish the shameful reasons for which his uncle Mocenigo had disgraced me. I do not know whether these gentlemen shewed my letters to Querini, but I do know that the secretary Oliviera sent me my passport. Thereupon the Count Aranda furnished me with a passport signed by the king.',\n",
       " 'On the last day of the year I left Barcelona with a servant who sat behind my chaise, and I agreed with my driver to take me to Perpignan by January 3rd, 1769. The driver was a Piedmontese and a worthy man: The next day he came into the room of the wayside inn where I was dining, and in the presence of my man asked me whether I had any suspicion that I was being followed. \"Well, I may be,\" I said, \"but what makes you ask that question?\" \"As you were leaving Barcelona yesterday, I noticed three ill–looking fellows watching us, armed to the teeth. They dined here to–day, and they went on three quarters of an hour ago. They don\\'t speak to anyone, and I don\\'t like the looks of them. \" \"What shall we do to avoid assassination, or the dread of it?\" \"We must start late, and stop at an inn I know of, a league this side of the ordinary stage where they will be awaiting us. If they turn back, and sleep at the same inn as ourselves, we shall be certain.',\n",
       " '\" I thought the idea a sensible one, and we started, I going on foot nearly the whole way; and at five o\\'clock we halted at a wretched inn, but we saw no signs of the sinister trio. At eight o\\'clock I was at supper, when my man came in and told me that the three fellows had come back, and were drinking with our driver in the stable. At present, it was true, I had nothing to fear; but it would be getting dark when we arrived at the frontier, and then my peril would come. I told my servant to shew no sign, but to ask the driver to come and speak with me when the assassins were asleep. He came at ten o\\'clock, and told me plainly that we should be all murdered as we approached the French frontier. \"Then you have been drinking with them?\" \"Yes, and after we had dispatched a bottle at my expense, one of them asked me why I had not gone on to the end of the stage, where you would be better lodged.',\n",
       " 'I might have asked in my turn, why they had not stayed at the stage themselves, and where they were going, but I took care to do nothing of the kind. All I asked was whether the road to Perpignan was a good one, and they told me it was excellent all the way. \" \"What are they doing now?\" \"They are sleeping by my mules, covered with their cloaks. \" \"What shall we do?\" \"We will start at day–break after them, of course, and we shall dine at the usual stage; but after dinner, trust me, we will take a different road, and at midnight we shall be in France safe and sound. \" If I could have procured a good armed escort I would not have taken his advice, but in the situation I was in I had no choice. We found the three scoundrels in the place where the driver had told me we should see them. I gave them a searching glance, and thought they looked like true Sicarii, ready to kill anyone for a little money.',\n",
       " \"They started in a quarter of an hour, and half an hour later we set out, with a peasant to guide us, and so struck into a cross road. The mules went at a sharp pace, and in seven hours we had done eleven leagues. At ten o'clock we stopped at an inn in a French village, and we had no more to fear. I gave our guide a doubloon, with which he was well pleased, and I enjoyed once more a peaceful night in a French bed, for nowhere will you find such soft beds or such delicious wines as in the good land of France. The next day I arrived at the posting–inn at Perpignan in time for dinner. I endeavoured in vain to think who could have paid my assassins, but the reader will see the explanation when we get twenty days farther. At Perpignan I dismissed my driver and my servant, rewarding them according to my ability. I wrote to my brother at Paris, telling him I had had a fortunate escape from the dagger of the assassin.\",\n",
       " 'I begged him to direct his answer to Aix, where I intended to spend a fortnight, in the hope of seeing the Marquis d\\'Argens. I left Perpignan the day after my arrival, and slept at Narbonne, and the day after at Beziers. The distance from Narbonne to Beziers is only five leagues, and I had not intended to stop; but the good cheer which the kindest of landladies gave me at dinner made me stop with her to supper. Beziers is a town which looks pleasant even at the worst time of the year. A philosopher who wished to renounce all the vanities of the world, and an Epicurean who would enjoy good cheer cheaply, could find no better retreat than Beziers. Everybody at Beziers is intelligent, all the women are pretty, and the cooks are all artists; the wines are exquisite—what more could one desire! May its riches never prove its ruin! When I reached Montpellier, I got down at the \"White Horse,\" with the intention of spending a week there.',\n",
       " \"In the evening I supped at the table d'hote, where I found a numerous company, and I saw to my amusement that for every guest there was a separate dish brought to table. 'Tis a veritable land of Cocagne! The next day I breakfasted at the cafe (an institution peculiar to France, the only country where the science of living is really understood), and addressed the first gentleman I met, telling him that I was a stranger and that I would like to know some of the professors. He immediately offered to take me to one of the professors who enjoyed a great reputation. Herein may be seen another of the good qualities of the French, who rank above other nations by so many titles. To a Frenchman a foreigner is a sacred being; he receives the best of hospitality, not merely in form, but in deed; and his welcome is given with that easy grace which so soon sets a stranger at his ease.\",\n",
       " 'My new friend introduced me to the professor, who received me with all the polished courtesy of the French man of letters. He that loves letters should love all other lovers of letters, and in France that is the case, even more so than Italy. In Germany the literary man has an air of mysterious reserve. He thinks he is proclaiming to all the world that he at all events is a man of no pretension, whereas his pride peeps through every moment. Naturally the stranger is not encouraged by such a manner as this. At the time of my visit there was an excellent company of actors at Montpellier, whom I went to see the same evening. My bosom swelled at finding myself in the blessed air of France after all the annoyances I had gone through in Spain. I seemed to have become young again; but I was altered, for several beautiful and clever actresses appeared on the stage without arousing any desires within me; and I would have it so.',\n",
       " \"I had a lively desire to find Madame Castelbajac, not with any wish to renew my old relations with her. I wished to congratulate her on her improved position, but I was afraid of compromising her by asking for her in the town. I knew that her husband was an apothecary, so I resolved to make the acquaintance of all the apothecaries in the place. I pretended to be in want of some very rare drugs, and entered into conversation about the differences between the trade in France and in foreign countries. If I spoke to the master I hoped he would talk to his wife about the stranger who had visited the countries where she had been, and that that would make her curious to know me. If, on the other hand, I spoke to the man, I knew he would soon tell me all he knew about his master's family. My old friend wrote me a note, telling me that she had seen me speaking to her husband in his shop.\",\n",
       " 'She begged me to come again at a certain time, and to tell her husband that I had known her under the name of Mdlle. Blasin in England, Spa, Leipzig, and Vienna, as a seller of lace. She ended her note with these words: \"I have no doubt that my husband will finally introduce you to me as his wife. \" I followed her advice, and the good man asked me if I had ever known a young lace seller of the name of Mdlle. \"Yes, I remember her well enough—a delightful and most respectable young woman; but I did not know she came from Montpellier. She was very pretty and very sensible, and I expect she did a good business. I have seen her in several European cities, and the last time at Vienna, where I was able to be of some slight service to her. Her admirable behaviour won her the esteem of all the ladies with whom she came in contact.',\n",
       " '\" \"Do you think you would recognize her if you saw her again?\" \"By Jove! I should think so! But is she at Montpellier? If so, tell her that the Chevalier de Seingalt is here. \" \"Sir, you shall speak to her yourself, if you will do me the honour to follow me. The worthy apothecary went through the shop, climbed a stair, and, opening a door on the first floor, said to me,— \"There she is. \" \"What, mademoiselle! You here? I am delighted to see you. \" \"This is not a young lady, sir, \\'tis my dear wife; but I hope that will not hinder you from embracing her. \" \"I have never had such an honour; but I will avail myself of your permission with pleasure. I congratulate both of you, and wish you all health and happiness. Tell me, did you have a pleasant journey from Vienna to Lyons?\" Madame Blasin (for so I must continue to designate her) answered my question according to her fancy, and found me as good an actor as she was an actress.',\n",
       " 'We were very glad to see each other again, but the apothecary was delighted at the great respect with which I treated his wife. For a whole hour we carried on a conversation of a perfectly imaginary character, and with all the simplicity of perfect truth. She asked me if I thought of spending the carnival at Montpellier, and seemed quite mortified when I said that I thought of going on the next day. Her husband hastened to say that that was quite out of the question. \"Oh, I hope you won\\'t go,\" she added, \"you must do my husband the honour of dining with us. \" After the husband had pressed me for some time I gave in, and accepted their invitation to dinner for the day after next. I was much pleased with the husband\\'s mother, who was advanced in years but extremely intelligent. She had evidently made a point of forgetting everything unpleasant in the past history of her son\\'s wife.',\n",
       " 'Madame Blasin told me in private that she was perfectly happy, and I had every reason to believe that she was speaking the truth. She had made a rule to be most precise in fulfilling her wifely duties, and rarely went out unless accompanied by her husband or her mother–in–law. I spent these four days in the enjoyment of pure and innocent friendship without there being the slightest desire on either side to renew our guilty pleasures. On the third day after I had dined with her and her husband, she told me, while we were alone for a moment, that if I wanted fifty louis she knew where to get them for me. I told her to keep them for another time, if I was so happy as to see her again, and so unhappy as to be in want. I left Montpellier feeling certain that my visit had increased the esteem in which her husband and her mother–in–law held her, and I congratulated myself on my ability to be happy without committing any sins.',\n",
       " 'The day after I had bade them farewell, I slept at Nimes, where I spent three days in the company of a naturalist: M. de Seguier, the friend of the Marquis Maffei of Verona. In his cabinet of natural history I saw and admired the immensity and infinity of the Creator\\'s handiwork. Nimes is a town well worthy of the stranger\\'s observation; it provides food for the mind, and the fair sex, which is really fair there, should give the heart the food it likes best. I was asked to a ball, where, as a foreigner, I took first place—a privilege peculiar to France, for in England, and still more in Spain, a foreigner means an enemy. On leaving Nimes I resolved to spend the carnival at Aix, where the nobility is of the most distinguished character. I believe I lodged at the \"Three Dolphins,\" where I found a Spanish cardinal on his way to Rome to elect a successor to Pope Rezzonico.',\n",
       " 'Chapter III My Stay at Aix; I Fall Ill--i Am Cared for by an Unknown Lady--the Marquis D\\'argens--cagliostro My room was only separated from his Castilian eminence\\'s by a light partition, and I could hear him quite plainly reprimanding his chief servant for being too economical. \"My lord, I do my best, but it is really impossible to spend more, unless I compel the inn–keepers to take double the amount of their bills; and your eminence will admit that nothing in the way of rich and expensive dishes has been spared. \" \"That may be, but you ought to use your wits a little; you might for example order meals when we shall not require any. Take care that there are always three tables—one for us, one for my officers, and the third for the servants. Why I see that you only give the postillions a franc over the legal charge, I really blush for you; you must give them a crown extra at least.',\n",
       " 'When they give you change for a louis, leave it on the table; to put back one\\'s change in one\\'s pocket is an action only worthy of a beggar. They will be saying at Versailles and Madrid, and maybe at Rome itself, that the Cardinal de la Cerda is a miser. I am no such thing, and I do not want to be thought one. You must really cease to dishonour me, or leave my service. \" A year before this speech would have astonished me beyond measure, but now I was not surprised, for I had acquired some knowledge of Spanish manners. I might admire the Senor de la Cerda\\'s prodigality, but I could not help deploring such ostentation on the part of a Prince of the Church about to participate in such a solemn function. What I had heard him say made me curious to see him, and I kept on the watch for the moment of his departure. What a man! He was not only ill made, short and sun–burnt; but his face was so ugly and so low that I concluded that AEsop himself must have been a little Love beside his eminence.',\n",
       " \"I understood now why he was so profuse in his generosity and decorations, for otherwise he might well have been taken for a stableboy. If the conclave took the eccentric whim of making him pope, Christ would never have an uglier vicar. I enquired about the Marquis d'Argens soon after the departure of his eminence, and was told that he was in the country with his brother, the Marquis d'Eguille, President of the Parliament, so I went there. This marquis, famous for his friendship for Frederick II. rather than for his writings (which are no longer read), was an old man when I saw him. He was a worthy man, fond of pleasure, a thorough–paced Epicurean, and had married an actress named Cochois, who had proved worthy of the honour he had laid on her. He was deeply learned and had a thorough knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew literature. He received me very well, and recalled what his friend the marshal had written about me.\",\n",
       " 'He introduced me to his wife and to his brother, a distinguished jurist, a man of letters, and a strictly moral man by temperament as much as religion. Though a highly intellectual man, he was deeply and sincerely religious. He was very fond of his brother, and grieved for his irreligion, but hoped that grace would eventually bring him back to the fold of the Church. His brother encouraged him in his hopes, while laughing at them in private, but as they were both sensible men they never discussed religion together. I was introduced to a numerous company of both sexes, chiefly consisting of relations. All were amiable and highly polished, like all the Provencal nobility. Plays were performed on the miniature stage, good cheer prevailed, and at intervals we walked in the garden, in spite of the weather. In Province, however, the winter is only severe when the wind blows from the north, which unfortunately often happens.',\n",
       " \"Among the company were a Berlin lady (widow of the marquis's nephew) and her brother. This young gentleman, who was gay and free from care, enjoyed all the pleasures of the house without paying any attention to the religious services which were held every day. If he thought on the matter at all, he was a heretic; and when the Jesuit chaplain was saying mass he amused himself by playing on the flute; he laughed at everything. He was unlike his sister, who had not only become a Catholic, but was a very devout one. Her brother told me that her husband, who had died of consumption, and whose mind was perfectly clear to the last, as is usually the case in phthisis, had told her that he could not entertain any hopes of seeing her in the other world unless she became a Catholic. These words were engraved on her heart; she had adored her husband, and she resolved to leave Berlin to live with his relations.\",\n",
       " \"No one ventured to oppose this design, her brother accompanying her, and she was welcomed joyfully by all her husband's kinsfolk. Her brother, finding me less strict than the others, soon constituted himself my friend. He came over to Aix every day, and took me to the houses of all the best people. We were at least thirty at table every day, the dishes were delicate without undue profusion, the conversation gay and animated without any improprieties. I noticed that whenever the Marquis d'Argens chanced to let slip any equivocal expressions, all the ladies made wry faces, and the chaplain hastened to turn the conversation. This chaplain had nothing jesuitical in his appearance; he dressed in the costume of an ordinary priest, and I should never had known him if the Marquis d'Argens had not warned me. However, I did not allow his presence to act as a wet blanket.\",\n",
       " 'I told, in the most decent manner possible, the story of the picture of the Virgin suckling her Divine Child, and how the Spaniards deserted the chapel after a stupid priest had covered the beautiful breast with a kerchief. I do not know how it was, but all the ladies began to laugh. The disciple of Loyola was so displeased at their mirth, that he took upon himself to tell me that it was unbecoming to tell such equivocal stories in public. I thanked him by an inclination of the head, and the Marquis d\\'Argens, by way of turning the conversation, asked me what was the Italian for a splendid dish of stewed veal, which Madame d\\'Argens was helping. \"Una crostata,\" I replied, \"but I really do not know the Italian for the \\'beatilles\\' with which it is stuffed. \" These \\'beatilles\\' were balls of rice, veal, champignons, artichoke, foie gras, etc. The Jesuit declared that in calling them \\'beatilles\\' I was making a mock of the glories of hereafter.',\n",
       " 'I could not help roaring with laughter at this, and the Marquis d\\'Eguille took my part, and said that \\'beatilles\\' was the proper French for these balls. After this daring difference of opinion with his director, the worthy man thought it would be best to talk of something else. Unhappily, however, he fell out of the frying–pan into the fire by asking me my opinion as to the election of the next pope. \"I believe it will be Ganganelli,\" I replied, \"as he is the only monk in the conclave. \" \"Why should it be necessary to choose a monk?\" \"Because none but a monk would dare to commit the excess which the Spaniards will demand of the new pope. \" \"I hope not, for the Jesuits were my masters, and I love them accordingly. But all the same Ganganelli will be elected, for an amusing and yet a weighty reason. \" \"He is the only cardinal who does not wear a wig; and you must consider that since the foundation of the Holy See the Pope has never been bewigged.',\n",
       " '\" This reason created a great deal of amusement; but the conversation was brought back to the suppression of the Jesuits, and when I told the company that I had heard from the Abbe Pinzi I saw the Jesuit turn pale. \"It seems that you have never been at a Jesuit seminary,\" I replied, \"for the dogma of the order is that the Pope can do everything, \\'et aliquid pluris\\'. \" This answer made everybody suppose me to be unaware that I was speaking to a Jesuit, and as he gave me no answer the topic was abandoned. After dinner I was asked to stay and see \\'Polieucte\\' played; but I excused myself, and returned to Aix with the young Berliner, who told me the story of his sister, and made me acquainted with the character of the society to which the Marquis d\\'Eguille was chiefly addicted. I felt that I could never adapt myself to their prejudices, and if it had not been for my young friend, who introduced me to some charming people, I should have gone on to Marseilles.',\n",
       " 'What with assemblies, balls, suppers, and the society of the handsome Provenqal ladies, I managed to spend the whole of the carnival and a part of Lent at Aix. I had made a present of a copy of the \"Iliad\" to the learned Marquis d\\'Argens; to his daughter, who was also a good scholar, I gave a Latin tragedy. The \"Iliad\" had Porphyry\\'s comment; it was a copy of a rare edition, and was richly bound. As the marquis came to Aix to thank me, I had to pay another visit to the country house. I had no cloak, and a cold north wind was blowing; I was perishing with cold, but instead of going to bed at once I accompanied the Berliner to the house of a woman who had a daughter of the utmost beauty. Though the girl was only fourteen, she had all the indications of the marriageable age, and yet none of the Provencal amateurs had succeeded in making her see daylight. My friend had already made several unsuccessful efforts.',\n",
       " \"I laughed at him, as I knew it was all a cheat, and I followed him to the house with the idea of making the young imposter dismount from her high horse, as I had done in similar cases in England and Metz. We set to work; and, far from resisting, the girl said she would be only too glad to get rid of the troublesome burden. I saw that the difficulty only proceeded from the way she held herself, and I ought to have whipped her, as I had done in Venice twenty–five years ago, but I was foolish enough to try to take the citadel by storm. I wearied myself to no purpose for a couple of hours, and then went to my inn, leaving the young Prussian to do his best. I went to bed with a pain in my side, and after six hours' sleep awoke feeling thoroughly ill. My landlord called in an old doctor, who refused to let me blood. A severe cough came on, and the next day I began to spit blood. In six or seven days the malady became so serious that I was confessed and received the last sacraments.\",\n",
       " 'On the tenth day, the disease having abated for three days, my clever old doctor answered for my life, but I continued to spit blood till the eighteenth day. My convalescence lasted for three weeks, and I found it more trying than the actual illness, for a man in pain has no time to grow weary. Throughout the whole case I was tended day and night by a strange woman, of whom I knew nothing. She nursed me with the tenderest care, and I awaited my recovery to give her my sincere thanks. She was not an old woman, neither was she attractive looking. After Eastertide, feeling I was well enough to venture out, I thanked her to the best of my ability, and asked who had sent her to me. She told me it was the doctor, and so bade me farewell. A few days later I was thanking my old doctor for having procured me such a capital nurse, but he stared at me and said he knew nothing about the woman.',\n",
       " 'I was puzzled, and asked my landlord if she could throw any light on the strange nurse\\'s identity; but she knew nothing, and her ignorance seemed universal. I could not discover whence or how she came to attend me. After my convalescence I took care to get all the letters which had been awaiting me, and amongst them was a letter from my brother in Paris, in answer to the epistle I wrote him from Perpignan. He acknowledged my letter, and told me how delighted he had been to receive it, after hearing the dreadful news that I had been assassinated on the borders of Catalonia at the beginning of January. \"The person who gave me the news,\" my brother added, \"was one of your best friends, Count Manucci, an attache at the Venetian embassy. He said there could be no doubt as to the truth of the report. This friend of mine had pushed his vengeance so far as to pay assassins to deprive me of my life. He must have been pretty well qualified to prophesy, as he was so certain of my death.',\n",
       " \"He might have known that in thus proclaiming in advance the manner of my death, he was also proclaiming himself as my murderer. I met him at Rome, two years later, and when I would have made him confess his guilt, he denied everything, saying he had received the news from Barcelona; however, we will speak of this in its proper place. I dined and supped every day at the table d'hote, and one day I heard the company talking of a male and female pilgrim who had recently arrived. They were said to be high–born folks, as they had distributed large alms on their entry into the town. It was said that the female pilgrim, who had gone to bed on her arrival, was charming. They were staying at the same inn as I was, and we all got very curious about them. As an Italian, I put myself at the head of the band who proceeded to call on the pilgrims, who, in my opinion, must either be fanatics or rogues. We found the lady sitting in an arm–chair, looking very tired.\",\n",
       " 'She was young, beautiful, and melancholy–looking, and in her hands she held a brass crucifix some six inches long. She laid it down when we came in, and got up and received us most graciously. Her companion, who was arranging cockle–shells on his black mantle, did not stir; he seemed to say, by glancing at his wife, that we must confine our attentions to her. He seemed a man of twenty–four or twenty–five years of age. He was short and badly hung, and his face bore all the indications of daring, impudence, sarcasm, and imposture. His wife, on the other hand, was all meekness and simplicity, and had that modesty which adds so much to the charm of feminine beauty. They only spoke just enough French to make themselves understood on their journey, and when they heard me addressing them in Italian they seemed much relieved. The lady told me she was a Roman, but I could have guessed as much from her accent.',\n",
       " 'Their passport, dated Rome, called him Balsamo, while she bore the names of Serafina Feliciani, which she still retains. Ten years later we shall hear more of this couple under the name of Cagliostro. \"We are going back to Rome,\" said she, \"well pleased with our devotions to St. We have walked the whole way on foot, living on alms, so as to more surely win the mercy of the God whom I have offended so grievously. We have had silver, and even gold money given us, and in every town we came to we gave what remained to the poor, so as not to offend God by lack of faith. \"My husband is strong, and has not suffered much, but I have found so much walking very fatiguing. We have slept on straw or bad beds, always with our clothes on, to avoid contracting diseases it would be hard to rid one\\'s self of. \" It seemed to me that this last circumstance was added to make us wish to find out whether the rest of her body could compare with her hands and arms in whiteness.',\n",
       " '\"Do you think of making any stay?\" \"My weariness will oblige us to stay here for three days; then we shall go to Rome by the way of Turin, where we shall pay our devotion to the Holy Sudary. \" \"You know, of course, that there are several of them in Europe. \" \"So we have heard, but we are assured that the Sudary of Turin is the true one. Veronica wiped the face of Our Lord, who left the imprint of His divine face upon it. \" We left them, well pleased with the appearance and manners of the lady pilgrim, but placing very little trust in her devotion. I was still weak from my illness, and she inspired me with no desires, but the rest would have gladly supped with her if they had thought there was anything to follow. Next day her husband asked me if I would come up and breakfast with them, or if they should come down and breakfast with me. It would have been impolite to have replied neither, so I said that I should be delighted to see them in my room.',\n",
       " 'At breakfast I asked the pilgrim what he did, and he replied that he was an artist. He could not design a picture, but he could copy it, and he assured me that he could copy an engraving so exactly that none could tell the copy from the original. If you are not a rich man, you are, at least, certain of earning a living with this talent. I have pursued this craft at Rome and at Naples, and found I had to work all day to make half a tester, and that\\'s not enough to live on. \" He then shewed me some fans he had done, and I thought them most beautiful. They were done in pen and ink, and the finest copper–plate could not have surpassed them. Next he showed me a copy from a Rembrandt, which if anything, was finer than the original. In spite of all he swore that the work he got barely supported him, but I did not believe what he said. He was a weak genius who preferred a vagabond life to methodical labour.',\n",
       " \"I offered a Louis for one of his fans, but he refused to take it, begging me to accept the fan as a gift, and to make a collection for him at the table d'hote, as he wanted to start the day after next. I accepted the present and promised to do as he desired, and succeeded in making up a purse of two hundred francs for them. She was asked to write her name on a lottery ticket, but refused, saying that no honest girls were taught to write at Rome. Everybody laughed at this excuse except myself, and I pitied her, as I could see that she was of very low origin. Next day she came and asked me to give her a letter of introduction for Avignon. Audifret the banker, and the other to the landlady of the inn. In the evening she returned me the letter to the banker, saying that it was not necessary for their purposes. At the same time she asked me to examine the letter closely, to see if it was really the same document I had given her. She laughed, and told me I was mistaken as it was only a copy.\",\n",
       " '\"Impossible!\" She called her husband, who came with the letter in his hand. I could doubt no longer, and said to him,— \"You are a man of talents, for it is much harder to imitate a handwriting than an engraving. You ought to make this talent serve you in good stead; but be careful, or it may cost you your life. In ten years I saw them again under the name of Count and Countess Pellegrini. At the present period he is in a prison which he will probably never leave, and his wife is happy, maybe, in a convent.',\n",
       " \"Chapter IV My Departure--letter From Henriette--marsellies--history of Nina--nice-- Turin--lugano--madame De**** As soon as I had regained my usual strength, I went to take leave of the Marquis d'Argens and his brother. I dined with them, pretending not to observe the presence of the Jesuit, and I then spent three delightful hours in conversation with the learned and amiable Marquis d'Argens. He told me a number of interesting anecdotes about the private life of Frederick II. No doubt the reader would like to have them, but I lack the energy to set them down. Perhaps some other day when the mists about Dux have dispersed, and some rays of the sun shine in upon me, I shall commit all these anecdotes to paper, but now I have not the courage to do so. Frederick had his good and his bad qualities, like all great men, but when every deduction on the score of his failings has been made, he still remains the noblest figure in the eighteenth century.\",\n",
       " \"The King of Sweden, who has been assassinated, loved to excite hatred that he might have the glory of defying it to do its worst. He was a despot at heart, and he came to a despot's end. He might have foreseen a violent death, for throughout his life he was always provoking men to the point of despair. There can be no comparison between him and Frederick. The Marquis d'Argens made me a present of all his works, and on my asking him if I could congratulate myself on possessing the whole number, he said yes, with the exception of a fragment of autobiography which he had written in his youth, and which he had afterwards suppressed. Never give way to this temptation, if it assails you. If you once begin on this plan you are not only compelled to record all your vices and follies, but to treat them in the severe tone of a philosophical historian. You must not, of course, omit the good you may have done; and so praise and blame is mingled on every page.\",\n",
       " 'All the evil you say of yourself will be held for gospel, your peccadilloes will be made into crimes, and your good deeds will not only be received with incredulity, but you will be taxed with pride and vanity for having recorded them. Besides, if you write your memoirs, you make an enemy in every chapter if you once begin to tell the truth. A man should neither talk of himself nor write of himself, unless it be to refute some calumny or libel. \" I was convinced, and promised never to be guilty of such a folly, but in spite of that I have been writing memoirs for the last seven years, and though I repent of having begun, I have sworn to go on to the end. However, I write in the hope that my Memoirs may never see the light of day; in the first place the censure would not allow them to be printed, and in the second I hope I shall be strong–minded enough, when my last illness comes, to have all my papers burnt before my eyes.',\n",
       " 'If that be not the case I count on the indulgence of my readers, who should remember that I have only written my story to prevent my going mad in the midst of all the petty insults and disagreeables which I have to bear day by day from the envious rascals who live with me in this castle of Count Waldstein, or Wallenstein, at Dux. I write ten or twelve hours a day, and so keep black melancholy at bay. My readers shall hear more of my sufferings later on, if I do not die before I write them down. The day after Corpus Christi I left Aix for Marseilles. But here I must set down a circumstance that I had forgotten; I mean the procession of Corpus Christi. Everyone knows that this festival is celebrated with great ceremony all over Christendom; but at Aix these ceremonies are of such a nature that every man of sense must be shocked at my recital.',\n",
       " \"It is well known that this procession in honour of the Being of beings, represented under the sacramental forms, is followed by all the religious confraternities, and this is duly done at Aix; but the scandalous part of the ceremony is the folly and the buffoonery which is allowed in a rite which should be designed to stir up the hearts of men to awe and reverence their Creator. Instead of that, the devil, death, and the seven deadly sins, are impersonated in the procession. They are clad in the most absurd costumes, and make hideous contortions, beating and abusing each other in their supposed vexation at having to join in the Creator's praises. The people hoot and hiss them, the lower classes sing songs in derision of them, and play them all manner of tricks, and the whole scene is one of incredible noise, uproar, and confusion, more worthy of some pagan bacchanalia than a procession of Christian people.\",\n",
       " 'All the country–folk from five or six leagues around Aix pour into the town on that day to do honour to God. It is the only occasion of the kind, and the clergy, either knavish or ignorant, encourage all this shameful riot. The lower orders take it all in good faith, and anyone who raised any objection would run some risk, for the bishop goes in front of the saturnalia, and consequently it is all holy. I expressed my disapproval of the whole affair, as likely to bring discredit on religion, to a councillor of parliament, M. Marc; but he told me gravely that it was an excellent thing, as it brought no less than a hundred thousand francs into the town on the single day. I knew her real name, and remembering the message she had sent me by Marcoline I hoped to meet her in some assembly, being ready to adapt my conduct to hers. I had often heard her name mentioned, but I never allowed myself to ask any question, not wishing our old friendship to be suspected.',\n",
       " 'Believing her to be at her country house, I had resolved on paying her a visit, and had only stayed on at Aix so as to recover my health before seeing her. In due course I left Aix with a letter in my pocket for her, resolving to send it in, and to remain in my carriage till she asked me to get down. A man came to the door, took my letter, and said madam should have it without fail. She will be coming here in three weeks to spend the summer as usual. \" \"Will you let me write a letter?\" \"If you will get down you will find all the necessary materials in madam\\'s room. \" I went into the house, and to my extreme surprise found myself face to face with my nurse. \" \"How did you come to nurse me?\" \"If you will step upstairs I will tell you. \" Her story was as follows: \"Madam sent for me in haste, and told me to go and attend to you as if it were herself. She told me to say that the doctor had sent me if you asked any questions.',\n",
       " '\" \"Perhaps he was speaking the truth, but most likely he had received orders from madam. That\\'s all I know, but I wonder you haven\\'t seen her at Aix. \" \"She cannot see any company, for I have been everywhere. \" \"She does not see any company at her own house, but she goes everywhere. I must have seen her, and yet I do not think I could have passed her by unrecognized. You have been with her ten years?\" \"Yes, sir, as I had the honour of informing you. \" \"Has she changed? Has she had any sickness? Has she aged?\" \"Not at all. She has become rather stout, but I assure you you would take her for a woman of thirty. \" The woman went out, leaving me in astonishment, at the extraordinary situation in which I was placed. \"Ought I to return to Aix immediately?\" I asked myself. She has a town house, but does not see company, but she might surely see me: She loves me still. She cared for me all through my illness, and she would not have done so if she had become indifferent to me.',\n",
       " 'She must know that I have left Aix, and will no doubt guess that I am here now. Shall I go to her or shall I write? I resolved to write, and I told her in my letter that I should await her reply at Marseilles. I gave the letter to my late nurse, with some money to insure its being dispatched at once, and drove on to Marseilles where I alighted at an obscure inn, not wishing to be recognized. I had scarcely got out of my carriage when I saw Madame Schizza, Nina\\'s sister. They had been at Marseilles three or four days and were going to Leghorn. Madame Schizza was alone at the moment, her husband having gone out; and as I was full of curiosity I begged her to come up to my room while my dinner was getting ready. \"What is your sister doing? Is she still at Barcelona?\" \"Yes; but she will not be there long, for the bishop will not have her in the town or the diocese, and the bishop is stronger than the viceroy.',\n",
       " 'She only returned to Barcelona on the plea that she wished to pass through Catalonia of her way home, but she does not need to stay there for nine or ten months on that account. She will have to leave in a month for certain, but she is not much put out, as the viceroy is sure to keep her wherever she goes, and she may eventually succeed in ruining him. In the meanwhile she is revelling in the bad repute she has gained for her lover. \" \"I know something of her peculiarities; but she cannot dislike a man who has made her rich. Do you imagine this monster capable of any feelings of gratitude? She is not a human being, and no one knows her as I do. She has made the count commit a hundred acts of injustice so that all Spain may talk of her, and know that she has made herself mistress of his body and soul, and all he has. The worse his actions are, the more certain she feels that people will talk of her, and that is all she wants.',\n",
       " 'Her obligations to me are beyond counting, for she owes me all, even to her existence, and instead of continuing my husband in her service she has sent him about his business. \" \"Then I wonder how she came to treat me so generously. \" \"If you knew all, you would not feel grateful to her. \" \"She only paid for your keep at the inn and in prison to make people believe you were her lover, and to shame the count. All Barcelona knows that you were assassinated at her door, and that you were fortunate enough to run the fellow through. \" \"But she cannot have been the instigator of, or even the accomplice in, the plot for my assassination. \" \"I dare say, but everything in Nina is against nature. What I tell you is the bare truth, for I was a witness of it all. Whenever the viceroy visited her she wearied him with praise of your gallantry, your wit, your noble actions, comparing you with the Spaniards, greatly to their disadvantage.',\n",
       " '\"The count got impatient and told her to talk of something else, but she would not; and at last he went away, cursing your name. Two days before you came to grief he left her, saying,— \"\\'Valga me Dios! I will give you a pleasure you do not expect. \\' \"I assure you that when we heard the pistol–shot after you had gone, she remarked, without evincing the slightest emotion, that the shot was the pleasure her rascally Spaniard had promised her. \"\\'All the worse for the count,\\' she replied, \\'for his turn will come also. \\' \"Then she began laughing like a madcap; she was thinking of the excitement your death would cause in Barcelona. \"At eight o\\'clock the following day, your man came and told her that you had been taken to the citadel; and I will say it to her credit, she seemed relieved to hear you were alive. \" \"My man—I did not know that he was in correspondence with her. \" \"No, I suppose not; but I assure you the worthy man was very much attached to you.',\n",
       " 'She did not shew it me, but it no doubt contained instructions to supply you with everything. \"The man told us that he had seen your sword all red with blood, and that your cloak had a bullet hole through it. She was delighted, but do not think it was because she loved you; she was glad you had escaped that you might take your revenge. However, she was troubled by the pretext on which the count had had you arrested. \"Ricla did not come to see her that day, but he came the next day at eight o\\'clock, and the infamous creature received him with a smiling face. She told him she had heard he had imprisoned you, and that she was obliged to him, as he had, of course, done so to protect you from any fresh attempts on your life. \"He answered, dryly, that your arrest had nothing to do with anything that might have happened the night before.',\n",
       " 'He added that you had only been seized pending the examination of your papers, and that if they were found to be in good form, you would be set at liberty in the course of a few days. \"Nina asked him who was the man that you had wounded. He replied that the police were enquiring into the matter, but that so far they had neither found a dead man nor a wounded man, nor any traces of blood. All that had been found was Casanova\\'s hat, and this had been returned to him. \"I left them alone together till midnight, so I cannot say what further converse they may have had on the subject, but three or four days later everybody knew that you were imprisoned in the tower. \"Nina asked the count the reason of this severity in the evening, and he replied that your passports were thought to be forgeries, because you were in disgrace with the State Inquisitors, and therefore would not be in a position to get a passport from the Venetian ambassador.',\n",
       " 'On this supposition he said you had been placed in the tower, and if it proved to be a true one, you would be still more severely punished. \"This news disturbed us, and when we heard that Pogomas had been arrested we felt certain he had denounced you in revenge for your having procured his dismissal from Nina\\'s house. When we heard that he had been let out and sent to Genoa, we expected to hear of your being set at liberty, as the authorities must have been satisfied of the genuine character of your passports; but you were still shut up, and Nina did not know what to think, and the count would not answer her when she made enquiries about you. She had made up her mind to say no more about it, when at last we heard you had been set free and that your passports had been declared genuine. \"Nina thought to see you in the pit of the opera–house, and made preparations for a triumph in her box; but she was in despair when she heard no performance was to be given.',\n",
       " 'In the evening the count told her that your passports had been returned with the order to leave in three days. The false creature praised her lover\\'s prudence to his face, but she cursed him in her heart. \"She knew you would not dare to see her, and when you left without writing her a note, she said you had received secret orders not to hold any further communications with her. \"\\'If Casanova had had the courage to ask me to go with him, I would have gone,\\' said she. \"Your man told her of your fortunate escape from three assassins. In the evening she congratulated Ricla on the circumstance, but he swore he knew nothing about it. You may thank God from the bottom of your heart that you ever left Spain alive after knowing Nina. She would have cost you your life at last, and she punishes me for having given her life. \" \"What! Are you her mother?\" \"Yes; Nina, that horrible woman, is my daughter. \" \"That is the horrible part of it, everybody is right.',\n",
       " '\" \"Explain yourself!\" \"Yes, though it is to my shame. She is my sister and my daughter, for she is the daughter of my father. \" \"What! your father loved you?\" \"I do not know whether the scoundrel loved me, but he treated me as his wife. She is the daughter of the crime, and God knows she is sufficient punishment for it. My father died to escape her vengeance; may he also escape the vengeance of God. I should have strangled her in her cradle, but maybe I shall strangle her yet. \" I remained dumb at the conclusion of this dreadful story, which bore all the marks of truth. \"Does Nina know that you are her mother?\" \"Her own father told her the secret when she was twelve, after he had initiated her into the life she has been living ever since. He would have made her a mother in her turn if he had not killed himself the same year, maybe to escape the gallows. \" \"How did the Conte de Ricla fall in love with her?\" \"It is a short story and a curious one.',\n",
       " 'Two years ago she came to Barcelona from Portugal, and was placed in one of the ballets for the sake of her pretty face, for as to talents she had none, and could only do the rebaltade (a sort of skip and pirouette) properly. \"The first evening she danced she was loudly applauded by the pit, for as she did the rebaltade she shewed her drawers up to her waist. In Spain any actress who shews her drawers on the stage is liable to a fine of a crown. Nina knew nothing about this, and, hearing the applause, treated the audience to another skip of the same kind, but at the end of the ballet she was told to pay two crowns for her immodesty. What do you think she did to elude the law, and at the same time avenge herself?\" \"Danced badly, perhaps. \" \"She danced without any drawers at all, and did her rebdltade as before, which caused such an effervescence of high spirits in the house as had never been known at Barcelona.',\n",
       " '\"The Conte de Ricla had seen her from his box, and was divided between horror and admiration, and sent for the inspector to tell him that this impudent creature must be punished. \\' \"Presently Nina appeared in the viceroy\\'s box, and asked him, impudently, what he wanted with her. \"\\'You are an immodest woman, and have failed in your duty to the public. \\' \"\\'What have I done? \"\\'You performed the same skip as before. \\' \"\\'Yes, but I haven\\'t broken your law, for no one can have seen my drawers as I took the precaution not to put any on. What more can I do for your cursed law, which has cost me two crowns already? Just tell me. \\' \"The viceroy and the great personages around him had much ado to refrain from laughter, for Nina was really in the right, and a serious discussion of the violated law would have been ridiculous. \"The viceroy felt he was in a false position, and merely said that if she ever danced without drawers again she should have a month\\'s imprisonment on bread and water.',\n",
       " '\"A week after one of my husband\\'s ballets was given. It was so well received that the audience encored it with enthusiasm. Ricla gave orders that the public should be satisfied, and all the dancers were told they would have to reappear. \"Nina, who was almost undressed, told my husband to do as best he could, as she was not going to dance again. As she had the chief part my husband could not do without her, and sent the manager to her dressing– room. She pushed the poor man out with so much violence that he fell against the wall of the passage, head foremost. \"The manager told his piteous tale to the viceroy, who ordered two soldiers to bring her before him.

       " '\"The count reproved her, but his voice and his manner were ill–assured, and growing bolder as she watched his embarrassment, Nina replied that he might have her torn to pieces if he liked, but she would not dance against her will, and nowhere in her agreement was it stipulated that she should dance twice in the same evening, whether for his pleasure or anyone else\\'s. She also expressed her anger at making her appear before him in a state of semi–nudity, and swore she would never forgive his barbarous and despotic conduct. Let me go away, or kill me if you like; do your worst on me, and you shall find that I am a Venetian and a free woman!\\' \"The viceroy sat astonished, and said she must be mad.

Naturally we have both grown older, and though I love you still I am glad you did not recognize me. Not that I have become ugly, but I am stout, and this gives me another look. I am a widow, and well enough off to tell you that if you lack money you will find some ready for you in Henriette\\'s purse. Do not come back to Aix to see me, as your return might give rise to gossip; but if you chance to come here again after some time, we may meet, though not as old acquaintances. I am happy to think that I have perhaps prolonged your days by giving you a nurse for whose trustworthiness I would answer. If you would like to correspond with me I should be happy to do my part.',\n",

I am grateful for the reticence you have observed, though Marcoline must have delivered the message I gave her. Farewell!\" I replied, accepting her offer to correspond, and I told her the whole story of my adventures. From her I received forty letters, in which the history of her life is given. If she die before me, I shall add these letters to my Memoirs, but at present she is alive and happy, though advanced in years. The day after I went to call on Madame Audibert, and we went together to see Madame N― N―, who was already the mother of three children.

Though a man can easily make a jest of his advancing years, a speech like this is not pleasant when one has not abandoned the pursuit of pleasure. She gave me a capital dinner, and her husband made me offers which I was ashamed to accept. I had fifty Louis, and, intending to go on to Turin, I did not feel uneasy about the future. At Marseilles I met the Duc de Vilardi, who was kept alive by the art of Tronchin. This nobleman, who was Governor of Provence, asked me to supper, and I was surprised to meet at his house the self–styled Marquis d'Aragon; he was engaged in holding the bank.\",\n",

I was not ashamed to borrow fifty Louis from this lucky rascal, though I felt almost certain that I should never return the money. I left Marseilles by myself, and after crossing the Alps arrived at Turin. There I had a warm welcome from the Chevalier Raiberti and the Comte de la Perouse. Both of them pronounced me to be looking older, but I consoled myself with the thought that, after all, I was only forty–four. I became an intimate friend of the English ambassador, Sir N―, a rich, accomplished and cultured man, who kept the choicest of tables.

The most generous of all was the Comte de la Perouse, who gave me two hundred and fifty francs for fifty copies. I left Turin in a week with two thousand lire in my purse. With this I should be able to print the book I had composed in my prison; but I should have to rewrite it \\'ab initio\\', with the volume to my hand, as also the \"History of Venice,\" by Nani. When I had got these works I set out with the intention of having my book printed at Lugano, as there was a good press there and no censure.

He reserved the right of censorship, expressing a hope that our opinions might coincide. I gave him the preface and the preliminary matter at once, and chose the paper and the size, large octavo.

My landlord was delighted to hear that I thought of making some stay at Lugano, and advised me to call on the high bailiff, who governed the place. \"He\\'s a very nice Swiss gentleman,\" said he, \"and his wife a clever woman, and as fair as the day. \" I sent in my name to the high bailiff at noon on the day following, and what was my surprise to find myself in the presence of M.',\n",

She shewed me her only child, who had been born four years after my departure. She cherished the child as the apple of her eye, and seemed likely to spoil it; but I heard, a few years ago, that this child is now an amiable and accomplished man.

It had been published for seventy years, but hitherto no one had taken the trouble to refute it.',\n",

I had been persecuted by the Venetian Government, so no one could accuse me of being partial; and by my exposing the calumnies of Amelot before all Europe I hoped to gain a reward, which after all would only be an act of justice. I had been an exile for fourteen years, and I thought the Inquisitors would be glad to repair their injustice on the pretext of rewarding my patriotism.

The abbe enjoyed such a reputation for wisdom amongst his fellow–countrymen that he was a kind of arbiter in all disputes, and thus the expenses of the law were saved. It was no wonder that the gentlemen of the long robe hated him most cordially. His nephew, Jean Baptiste Riva, was a friend of the Muses, of Bacchus, and of Venus; he was also a friend of mine, though I could not match him with the bottles. He lent me all the nymphs he had initiated into the mysteries, and they liked him all the better, as I made them some small presents. With him and his two pretty sisters I went to the Borromean Isles.',\n",

It would be impossible to describe these Islands of the Blest; they must be seen to be imagined. The inhabitants enjoy an everlasting spring; there is neither heat nor cold. The count regaled us choicely, and amused the two girls by giving them rods and lines and letting them fish. Although he was ugly, old, and ruined, he still possessed the art of pleasing.

A few days after these pleasant and cultured men had left, I was startled one morning by the sudden appearance of the wretched Marazzani in my room. I seized him by his collar, threw him out, and before he had time to use his cane or his sword, I had kicked, beaten, and boxed him most soundly. He defended himself to the best of his ability, and the landlord and his men ran up at the noise, and had some difficulty in separating us. \"Don\\'t let him go!\" I cried, \"send for the bargello and have him away to prison. \" I dressed myself hastily, and as I was going out to see M. de R―, the bargello met me, and asked me on what charge I gave the man into custody.',\n",

He had done me no harm, and I pitied him; but not being his intimate friend, and having no power to mitigate the hardship of his lot, I had well–nigh forgotten him. Eight months after, I met at Barcelona Madame Bellucci, a Venetian dancer, with whom I had had a small intrigue. She gave an exclamation of delight on seeing me, and said she was glad to see me delivered from the hard fate to which a tyrannous Government had condemned me. \"What fate is that?\" I asked, \"I have seen a good deal of misfortune since I left you. \" \"But that has never been my lot, thank God!

I seemed to have done nothing, and indeed, I had got as good as I gave. de R heard my statement he said he could neither keep him in prison nor drive him out of the town unless I laid a plea before him, craving protection against this man, whom I believed to have come to Lugano with the purpose of assassinating me. \"You can make the document more effective,\" he added, \"by placing your actual grievance in a strong light, and laying stress on his sudden appearance in your room without sending in his name. That\\'s what you had better do, and it remains to be seen how I shall answer your plea.',\n",

I sent in my plea, and the next day I had the pleasure of seeing him brought into the court bound hand and foot. de R began to examine him, and Marazzani swore he had no evil intentions in calling on me. As to the calumny, he protested he had only repeated common rumour, and professed his joy at finding it had been mistaken. This ought to have been enough for me, but I continued obdurate. de R― said the fact of my being sent to the galleys having been rumoured was no justification for his repeating it. Casanova's suspicion that you were going to assassinate him is justified by your giving a false name, for the plaintiff maintains that you are not Count Marazzani at all.

I left Lugano myself a few days later, having made up my mind to winter in Turin, where I hoped to see some pleasant society. Before I left I received a friendly letter from Prince Lubomirski, with a bill for a hundred ducats, in payment of fifty copies of my book. The prince had become lord high marshal on the death of Count Bilinski. When I got to Turin I found a letter from the noble Venetian M. Girolamo Zulian, the same that had given me an introduction to Mocenigo. Berlendis, the representative of the Republic at Turin, who thanked me for having enabled him to receive me. The ambassador, a rich man, and a great lover of the fair sex, kept up a splendid establishment, and this was enough for his Government, for intelligence is not considered a necessary qualification for a Venetian ambassador.\",\n",
       " \"Indeed it is a positive disadvantage, and a witty ambassador would no doubt fall into disgrace with the Venetian Senate. However, Berlendis ran no risk whatever on this score; the realm of wit was an unknown land to him. I got this ambassador to call the attention of his Government to the work I had recently published, and the answer the State Inquisitors gave may astonish my readers, but it did not astonish me. The secretary of the famous and accursed Tribunal wrote to say that he had done well to call the attention of the Inquisitors to this work, as the author's presumption appeared on the title–page. He added that the work would be examined, and in the mean time the ambassador was instructed to shew me no signal marks of favour lest the Court should suppose he was protecting me as a Venetian. Nevertheless, it was the same tribunal that had facilitated my access to the ambassador to Madrid—Mocenigo.\",\n",
       " \"I told Berlendis that my visits should be limited in number, and free from all ostentation. I was much interested in his son's tutor; he was a priest, a man of letters, and a poet. His name was Andreis, and he is now resident in England, where he enjoys full liberty, the greatest of all blessings. I spent my time at Turin very pleasantly, in the midst of a small circle of Epicureans; there were the old Chevalier Raiberti, the Comte de la Perouse, a certain Abbe Roubien, a delightful man, the voluptuous Comte de Riva, and the English ambassador. To the amusements which this society afforded I added a course of reading, but no love affairs whatever. While I was at Turin, a milliner, Perouse's mistress, feeling herself in 'articulo mortis', swallowed the portrait of her lover instead of the Eucharist. This incident made me compose two sonnets, which pleased me a good deal at the time, and with which I am still satisfied.\",\n",

The Russian squadron, under the command of Count Alexis Orloff, was then at Leghorn; this squadron threatened Constantinople, and would probably have taken it if an Englishman had been in command. As I had known Count Orloff in Russia, I imagined that I might possibly render myself of service to him, and at the same time make my fortune. The English ambassador having given me a letter for the English consul, I left Turin with very little money in my purse and no letter of credit on any banker. An Englishman named Acton commended me to an English banker at Leghorn, but this letter did not empower me to draw any supplies. Acton was just then involved in a curious complication. When he was at Venice he had fallen in love with a pretty woman, either a Greek or a Neapolitan.',\n",

The generous but proud and impatient Englishman could not be expected to bear this for long. He consulted with the lady, and determined to shew his teeth. The husband persisted in his untimely visits, and one day Acton said, dryly,— \"Do you want a thousand guineas? You can have them if you like, on the condition that your wife travels with me for three years without our having the pleasure of your society. \" The husband thought the bargain a good one, and signed an agreement to that effect. After the three years were over the husband wrote to his wife, who was at Venice, to return to him, and to Acton to put no obstacle in the way.',\n",
       " 'The lady replied that she did not want to live with him any more, and Acton explained to the husband that he could not be expected to drive his mistress away against her will. He foresaw, however, that the husband would complain to the English ambassador, and determined to be before–handed with him. In due course the husband did apply to the English ambassador, requesting him to compel Acton to restore to him his lawful wife. He even asked the Chevalier Raiberti to write to the Commendatore Camarana, the Sardinian ambassador at Venice, to apply pressure on the Venetian Government, and he would doubtless have succeeded if M. However, as it was he did nothing of the sort, and even gave Acton a warm welcome when he came to Turin to look into the matter. He had left his mistress at Venice under the protection of the English consul.',\n",
       " \"The husband was ashamed to complain publicly, as he would have been confronted with the disgraceful agreement he had signed; but Berlendis maintained that he was in the right, and argued the question in the most amusing manner. On the one hand he urged the sacred and inviolable character of the marriage rite, and on the other he shewed how the wife was bound to submit to her husband in all things. I argued the matter with him myself, shewing him his disgraceful position in defending a man who traded on his wife's charms, and he was obliged to give in when I assured him that the husband had offered to renew the lease for the same time and on the same terms as before. Two years later I met Acton at Bologna, and admired the beauty whom he considered and treated as his wife. I left Turin for Parma with a Venetian who, like myself, was an exile from his country. He had turned actor to gain a livelihood; and was going to Parma with two actresses, one of whom was interesting.\",\n",

This journey to Leghorn was undertaken under the influence of chimerical ideas. I thought I might be useful to Count Orloff, in the conquest he was going to make, as it was said, of Constantinople. I fancied that it had been decreed by fate that without me he could never pass through the Dardanelles. In spite of the wild ideas with which my mind was occupied, I conceived a warm friendship for my travelling companion, whose name was Angelo Bentivoglio. The Government never forgave him a certain crime, which to the philosophic eye appears a mere trifle. In four years later, when I describe my stay at Venice, I shall give some further account of him. About noon we reached Parma, and I bade adieu to Bentivoglio and his friends.',\n",

The reader will remember that I had known him twenty two years before, when I was in love with Henriette. He was delighted to see me, and seemed to set great store by my politeness in giving him the benefit of my short stay at Parma. I told him that Count Orloff was waiting for me at Leghorn, and that I was obliged to travel day and night. \"He will be setting sail before long,\" said he; \"I have advices from Leghorn to that effect. \" I said in a mysterious tone of voice that he would not sail without me, and I could see that my host treated me with increased respect after this. He wanted to discuss the Russian Expedition, but my air of reserve made him change the conversation.',\n",

He spent the whole afternoon in uttering complaints against the sovereigns of Europe, the King of Prussia excepted, as he had made him a baron, though I never could make out why. He cursed the Duke of Parma who persisted in retaining his services, although there was no mint in existence in the duchy, and his talents were consequently wasted there. I listened to all his complaints, and agreed that Louis XV. had been ungrateful in not conferring the Order of St. Michael on him; that Venice had rewarded his services very shabbily; that Spain was stingy, and Naples devoid of honesty, etc. When he had finished, I asked him if he could give me a bill on a banker for fifty sequins.',\n",

I took the money promising to repay him at an early date, but I have never been able to do so. I do not know whether he is alive or dead, but if he were to attain the age of Methuselah I should not entertain any hopes of paying him; for I get poorer every day, and feel that my end is not far off. The next day I was in Bologna, and the day after in Florence, where I met the Chevalier Morosini, nephew of the Venetian procurator, a young man of nineteen, who was travelling with Count Stratico, professor of mathematics at the University of Padua. He gave me a letter for his brother, a Jacobin monk, and professor of literature at Pisa, where I stopped for a couple of hours on purpose to make the celebrated monk's acquaintance.\",\n",

I stopped an hour at the Wells, where I made the acquaintance of the Pretender to the throne of Great Britain, and from there went on to Leghorn, where I found Count Orloff still waiting, but only because contrary winds kept him from sailing. The English consul, with whom he was staying, introduced me at once to the Russian admiral, who received me with expressions of delight. He told me he would be charmed if I would come on board with him. He told me to have my luggage taken off at once, as he would set sail with the first fair wind. When he was gone the English consul asked me what would be my status with the admiral. \"That\\'s just what I mean to find out before embarking my effects. \" \"You won\\'t be able to speak to him till to–morrow.',\n",

A moment after, Marquis Manucci came in with his order of St. He congratulated me on my visit to Leghorn, and then said he had read my work on Venice, and had been surprised to find himself in it. He had some reason for surprise, for there was no connection between him and the subject–matter; but he should have discovered before that the unexpected often happens.',\n",
       " 'He did not give me time to tell him so, but went into the admiral\\'s room as Da Loglio had done. I was vexed to see how these gentlemen were admitted while I danced attendance, and the project of sailing with Orloff began to displease me. In five hours Orloff came out followed by a numerous train. He told me pleasantly that we could have our talk at table or after dinner. He came in and sat down at two o\\'clock, and I was among the guests. Orloff kept on saying, \"Eat away, gentlemen, eat away;\" and read his correspondence and gave his secretary letters all the time. After dinner he suddenly glanced up at me, and taking me by the hand led me to the window, and told me to make haste with my luggage, as he should sail before the morning if the wind kept up. \"Quite so; but kindly tell me, count, what is to be my status or employment an board your ship?\" \"At present I have no special employ to give you; that will come in time.',\n",

I know the country for which you are bound, I can speak the language, and I am not wanting in courage. \" \"My dear sir, I really have no particular office to give you. \" \"Then, count, I wish you a pleasant sail; I am going to Rome. I hope you may never repent of not taking me, for without me you will never pass the Dardanelles. \" Such was the short dialogue I had with the worthy count, who, as a matter of fact, did not pass the Dardanelles. Whether he would have succeeded if I had been on board is more than I can say.',\n",
       " 'The day after I went to Pisa, and spent a pleasant week in the company of Father Stratico, who was made a bishop two or three years after by means of a bold stroke that might have ruined him. He delivered a funeral oration over Father Ricci, the last general of the Jesuits. The Pope, Ganganelli, had the choice of punishing the writer and increasing the odium of many of the faithful, or of rewarding him handsomely. I saw the bishop some years later, and he told me in confidence that he had only written the oration because he felt certain, from his knowledge of the human heart, that his punishment would be a great reward. This clever monk initiated me into all the charms of Pisan society. He had organized a little choir of ladies of rank, remarkable for their intelligence and beauty, and had taught them to sing extempore to the guitar. He had had them instructed by the famous Gorilla, who was crowned poetess–laureate at the capitol by night, six years later.',\n",
       " 'She was crowned where our great Italian poets were crowned; and though her merit was no doubt great, it was, nevertheless, more tinsel than gold, and not of that order to place her on a par with Petrarch or Tasso. She was satirised most bitterly after she had received the bays; and the satirists were even more in the wrong than the profaners of the capitol, for all the pamphlets against her laid stress on the circumstance that chastity, at all events, was not one of her merits. All poetesses, from the days of Homer to our own, have sacrificed on the altar of Venus. No one would have heard of Gorilla if she had not had the sense to choose her lovers from the ranks of literary men; and she would never have been crowned at Rome if she had not succeeded in gaining over Prince Gonzaga Solferino, who married the pretty Mdlle. Rangoni, daughter of the Roman consul, whom I knew at Marseilles, and of whom I have already spoken.',\n",
       " 'This coronation of Gorilla is a blot on the pontificate of the present Pope, for henceforth no man of genuine merit will accept the honour which was once so carefully guarded by the giants of human intellect. Two days after the coronation Gorilla and her admirers left Rome, ashamed of what they had done. The Abbe Pizzi, who had been the chief promoter of her apotheosis, was so inundated with pamphlets and satires that for some months he dared not shew his face. This is a long digression, and I will now return to Father Stratico, who made the time pass so pleasantly for me. Though he was not a handsome man, he possessed the art of persuasion to perfection; and he succeeded in inducing me to go to Sienna, where he said I should enjoy myself. He gave me a letter of introduction for the Marchioness Chigi, and also one for the Abbe Chiaccheri; and as I had nothing better to do I went to Sienna by the shortest way, not caring to visit Florence.',\n",
       " 'The Abbe Chiaccheri gave me a warm welcome, and promised to do all he could to amuse me; and he kept his word. He introduced me himself to the Marchioness Chigi, who took me by storm as soon as she had read the letter of the Abbe Stratico, her dear abbe, as she called him, when she read the superscription in his writing. The marchioness was still handsome, though her beauty had begun to wane; but with her the sweetness, the grace, and the ease of manner supplied the lack of youth. She knew how to make a compliment of the slightest expression, and was totally devoid of any affection of superiority. \"So you are going to stay a week, I see, from the dear abbe\\'s letter. That\\'s a short time for us, but perhaps it may be too long for you. I hope the abbe has not painted us in too rosy colours. \" \"He only told me that I was to spend a week here, and that I should find with you all the charms of intellect and sensibility. \" \"Stratico should have condemned you to a month without mercy.',\n",
       " '\" \"Why mercy? What hazard do I run?\" \"Of being tired to death, or of leaving some small morsel of your heart at Sienna. \" \"All that might happen in a week, but I am ready to dare the danger, for Stratico has guarded me from the first by counting on you, and from the second by counting on myself. My heart will go forth from Sienna as free as it came, for I have no hope of victory, and defeat would make me wretched. \" \"Is it possible that you are amongst the despairing?\" \"Yes, and to that fact I owe my happiness. \" \"It would be a pity for you if you found yourself mistaken. \\'Tis likewise the motto of that finished voluptuary, Horace, but I only take it because it suits me. The pleasure which follows desires is the best, for it is the most acute. \"True, but it cannot be calculated on, and defies the philosopher. May God preserve you, madam, from finding out this painful truth by experience! The highest good lies in enjoyment; desire too often remains unsatisfied.',\n",
       " 'If you have not yet found out the truth of Horace\\'s maxim, I congratulate you. \" The amiable marchioness smiled pleasantly and gave no positive answer. Chiaccheri now opened his mouth for the first time, and said that the greatest happiness he could wish us was that we should never agree. The marchioness assented, rewarding Chiaccheri with a smile, but I could not do so. \"I had rather contradict you,\" I said, \"than renounce all hopes of pleasing you. The abbe has thrown the apple of discord between us, but if we continue as we have begun I shall take up my abode at Sienna. \" The marchioness was satisfied with the sample of her wit which she had given me, and began to talk commonplaces, asking me if I should like to see company and enjoy society of the fair sex. \"I want to leave Sienna with the feeling that you are the only lady to whom I have done homage, and that the Abbe Chiaccheri has been my only guide.',\n",
       " '\" The marchioness was flattered, and asked the abbe and myself to dine with her on the following day in a delightful house she had at a hundred paces from the town. The older I grew the more I became attached to the intellectual charms of women. With the sensualist, the contrary takes place; he becomes more material in his old age: requires women well taught in Venus\\'s shrines, and flies from all mention of philosophy. As I was leaving her I told the abbe that if I stayed at Sienna I would see no other woman but her, come what might, and he agreed that I was very right. The abbe shewed me all the objects of interest in Sienna, and introduced me to the literati, who in their turn visited me. The same day Chiaccheri took me to a house where the learned society assembled. It was the residence of two sisters—the elder extremely ugly and the younger very pretty, but the elder sister was accounted, and very rightly, the Corinna of the place.',\n",
       " 'She asked me to give her a specimen of my skill, promising to return the compliment. I recited the first thing that came into my head, and she replied with a few lines of exquisite beauty. I complimented her, but Chiaccheri (who had been her master) guessed that I did not believe her to be the author, and proposed that we should try bouts rimes. The pretty sister gave out the rhymes, and we all set to work. The ugly sister finished first, and when the verses came to be read, hers were pronounced the best. I was amazed, and made an improvisation on her skill, which I gave her in writing. In five minutes she returned it to me; the rhymes were the same, but the turn of the thought was much more elegant. I was still more surprised, and took the liberty of asking her name, and found her to be the famous \"Shepherdess,\" Maria Fortuna, of the Academy of Arcadians. I had read the beautiful stanzas she had written in praise of Metastasio.',\n",
       " \"I told her so, and she brought me the poet's reply in manuscript. Full of admiration, I addressed myself to her alone, and all her plainness vanished. I had had an agreeable conversation with the marchioness in the morning, but in the evening I was literally in an ecstacy. I kept on talking of Fortuna, and asked the abbe if she could improvise in the manner of Gorilla. He replied that she had wished to do so, but that he had disallowed it, and he easily convinced me that this improvisation would have been the ruin of her fine talent. I also agreed with him when he said that he had warned her against making impromptus too frequently, as such hasty verses are apt to sacrifice wit to rhyme. The honour in which improvisation was held amongst the Greeks and Romans is due to the fact that Greek and Latin verse is not under the dominion of rhyme. But as it was, the great poets seldom improvised; knowing as they did that such verses were usually feeble and common–place.\",\n",
       " 'Horace often passed a whole night searching for a vigorous and elegantly–turned phrase. When he had succeeded, he wrote the words on the wall and went to sleep. The lines which cost him nothing are generally prosaic; they may easily be picked out in his epistles. The amiable and learned Abbe Chiaccheri, confessed to me that he was in love with his pupil, despite her ugliness. He added that he had never expected it when he began to teach her to make verses. \"I can\\'t understand that,\" I said, \"sublata lucerna\\', you know. \" \"Not at all,\" said he, with a laugh, \"I love her for her face, since it is inseparable from my idea of her. \" A Tuscan has certainly more poetic riches at his disposal than any other Italian, and the Siennese dialect is sweeter and more energetic than that of Florence, though the latter claims the title of the classic dialect, on account of its purity. This purity, together with its richness and copiousness of diction it owes to the academy.',\n",
       " 'From the great richness of Italian we can treat a subject with far greater eloquence than a French writer; Italian abounds in synonyms, while French is lamentably deficient in this respect. Voltaire used to laugh at those who said that the French tongue could not be charged with poverty, as it had all that was necessary. The obstinacy of the French academy in refusing to adopt foreign words skews more pride than wisdom. As for us we take words from all languages and all sources, provided they suit the genius of our own language. We love to see our riches increase; we even steal from the poor, but to do so is the general characteristic of the rich. The amiable marchioness gave us a delicious dinner in a house designed by Palladio. Chiaccheri had warned me to say nothing about the Shepherdess Fortuna; but at dinner she told him she was sure he had taken me to her house. He had not the face to deny it, and I did not conceal the pleasure I had received.',\n",
       " '\"Stratico admires Fortuna,\" said the marchioness, \"and I confess that her writings have great merit, but it\\'s a pity one cannot go to the house, except under an incognito. \"What!\" said she to the abbe, \"you did not tell him whose house it is?\" \"I did not think it necessary, her father and mother rarely shew themselves. \" \"But what is her father?\" I asked, \"the hangman, perhaps?\" \"Worse, he\\'s the \\'bargello\\', and you must see that a stranger cannot be received into good society here if he goes to such places as that. \" Chiaccheri looked rather hurt, and I thought it my duty to say that I would not go there again till the eve of my departure. \"I saw her sister once,\" said the marchioness; \"she is really charmingly pretty, and it\\'s a great pity that with her beauty and irreproachable morality she should be condemned to marry a man of her father\\'s class.',\n",
       " '\" \"I once knew a man named Coltellini,\" I replied; \"he is the son of the bargello of Florence, and is poet–in–ordinary to the Empress of Russia. I shall try to make a match between him and Fortuna\\'s sister; he is a young man of the greatest talents. \" The marchioness thought my idea an excellent one, but soon after I heard that Coltellini was dead. The \\'bargello\\' is a cordially–detested person all over Italy, if you except Modena, where the weak nobility make much of the \\'bargello\\', and do justice to his excellent table. This is a curious fact, for as a rule these bargellos are spies, liars, traitors, cheats, and misanthropes, for a man despised hates his despisers. At Sienna I was shewn a Count Piccolomini, a learned and agreeable man. He had a strange whim, however, of spending six months in the year in the strictest seclusion in his own house, never going out and never seeing any company; reading and working the whole time.',\n",
       " 'He certainly did his best to make up for his hibernation during the other six months in the year. The marchioness promised she would come to Rome in the course of the summer. She had there an intimate friend in Bianconi who had abandoned the practice of medicine, and was now the representative of the Court of Saxony. On the eve of my departure, the driver who was to take me to Rome came and asked me if I would like to take a travelling companion, and save myself three sequins. \" \"Is she by herself?\" \"No, she is with a gentleman on horseback, who wishes to ride all the way to Rome. \" \"Then how did the girl come here?\" \"On horseback, but she is tired out, and cannot bear it any longer. The gentleman has offered me four sequins to take her to Rome, and as I am a poor man I think you might let me earn the money. \" \"I suppose he will follow the carriage?\" \"He can go as he likes; that can\\'t make much difference to either of us. \" \"I have been told so, but I haven\\'t seen her myself.',\n",
       " '\" \"What sort of a man is her companion?\" \"He\\'s a fine man, but he can speak very little Italian. \" \"Has he sold the lady\\'s horse?\" \"No, it was hired. He has only one trunk, which will go behind the carriage. I shall not give any decision before speaking to this man. \" Directly afterwards, a brisk–looking young fellow, carrying himself well enough, and clad in a fancy uniform, came in. He told me the tale I had heard from the coachman, and ended by saying that he was sure I would not refuse to accommodate his wife in my carriage. \"Your wife, sir?\" I saw he was a Frenchman, and I addressed him in French. \" The next morning when I got into my carriage, I found her already there. I paid her some slight compliment, and sat down beside her, and we drove off.',\n",

There is nothing particularly out of the common in having a fellow–traveller in one's carriage; this time, however, the affair had something decidedly romantic about it. I was forty–five, and my purse contained two hundred sequins. I still loved the fair sex, though my ardour had decreased, my experience had ripened, and my caution increased. I was more like a heavy father than a young lover, and I limited myself to pretensions of the most modest character. The young person beside me was pretty and gentle–looking, she was neatly though simply dressed in the English fashion, she was fair and small, and her budding breast could be seen outlined beneath the fine muslin of her dress. She had all the appearances of modesty and noble birth, and something of virginal innocence, which inspired one with attachment and respect at the same time.\",\n",
       " '\" \"I congratulate myself on having you for my travelling companion. \" \"Yes, but I will never do such a foolish thing again. \" \"I think your husband would have been wise to sell his horse and buy a carriage. \" \"You like travelling?\" \"Very much, but with greater comfort. \" With these words the English girl, whose white skin did not look as if it could contain a drop of blood, blushed most violently. I guessed something of her secret, and begged pardon; and for more than an hour I remain silent, pretending to gaze at the scenery, but in reality thinking of her, for she began to inspire me with a lively interest. Though the position of my young companion was more than equivocal, I determined to see my way clearly before I took any decisive step; and I waited patiently till we got to Bon Couvent, where we expected to dine and meet the husband. In Italy the carriages never go faster than a walk; a man on foot can outstrip them, as they rarely exceed three miles an hour.',\n",

The English girl was astonished at not finding her husband, and looked for him in all directions. I noticed her, and asked the landlord what had become of him. He informed us that he had breakfasted and baited his horse, and had then gone on, leaving word that he would await us at St. The poor girl begged me to excuse her husband\\'s behaviour. \"He has given me a mark of his confidence, madam, and there is nothing to be offended at. \" The landlord asked me if the vetturino paid my expenses, and I answered in the negative; and the girl then told him to ask the vetturino if he was paying for her.',\n",
       " 'The man came in, and to convince the lady that providing her with meals was not in the contract, he gave her a paper which she handed to me to read. \" When she was alone with me my young companion begged me only to order dinner for myself. I understood her delicacy, and this made her all the dearer to me. \"Madame,\" said I, \"you must please look upon me as an old friend. I guess you have no money about you, and that you wish to fast from motives of delicacy. If I told the landlord to only prepare dinner for myself I should be dishonouring the count, yourself possibly, and myself most of all. Let dinner be served for two, then; but I cannot eat, for I feel ill, and I hope you will not mind my lying on the bed for a moment. This is a pleasant room, and they can lay the table in the next. Lie down, and sleep if you can, and I will order dinner to be ready by two. \" I left her without giving her time to answer, and went to order dinner.',\n",
       " 'I had ceased to believe the Frenchman to be the beautiful Englishwoman\\'s husband, and began to think I should have to fight him. The case, I felt certain, was one of elopement and seduction; and, superstitious as usual, I was sure that my good genius had sent me in the nick of time to save her and care for her, and in short to snatch her from the hands of her infamous deceiver. I laughed at the absurd title the rascal had given himself, and when the thought struck me that he had possibly abandoned her to me altogether, I made up my mind that he deserved hanging. I lay down on the bed, and as I built a thousand castles in the air I fell asleep. The landlady awoke me softly, saying that three o\\'clock had struck. \" I opened the door gently, and saw she was still asleep, but as I closed the door after me the noise awoke her, and she asked if I had dined. \"I shall not take any dinner, madam, unless you do me the honour to dine with me.',\n",

She was agreeably surprised to see the beefsteaks and plum pudding, which I had ordered for her. When the landlady came in, she asked her if the cook was an Englishman, and when she heard that I had given directions for the preparation of her national dishes, she seemed full of gratitude. She cheered up, and congratulated me on my appetite, while I encouraged her to drink some excellent Montepulciano and Montefiascone. By dessert she was in good spirits, while I felt rather excited. She told me, in Italian, that she was born in London, and I thought I should have died with joy, in reply to my question whether she knew Madame Cornelis, she replied that she had known her daughter as they had been at school together.',\n",
       " '\"Has Sophie grown tall?\" \"No, she is quite small, but she is very pretty, and so clever. \" As she said this she blushed and lowered her eyes. I scarcely like to say it, but Sophie is the very image of you. \" \"Why should you hesitate to say so? It has been remarked to me before. How long ago is it since you have seen her?\" \"Eighteen months; she went back to her mother\\'s, to be married as it was said, but I don\\'t know to whom. \" The landlord brought me the bill, and I saw a note of three pains which her husband had spent on himself and his horse. I was delighted to see her blushing, it proved she was not a party to her husband\\'s proceedings. I was burning with the desire to know how she had left London and had met the Frenchman, and why they were going to Rome; but I did not want to trouble her by my questions, and I loved her too well already to give her any pain. We had a three hours\\' drive before us, so I turned the conversation to Sophie, with whom she had been at school.',\n",
       " '\"Was Miss Nancy Steyne there when you left?\" said I. The reader may remember how fond I had been of this young lady, who had dined with me, and whom I had covered with kisses, though she was only twelve. My companion sighed at hearing the name of Nancy, and told me that she had left. \"Was she pretty when you knew her?\" \"She was a beauty, but her loveliness was a fatal gift to her. Nancy was a close friend of mine, we loved each other tenderly; and perhaps our sympathy arose from the similarity of the fate in store for us. Nancy, too loving and too simple, is now, perhaps, even more unhappy than myself. \" \"More unhappy? What do you mean?\" \"Alas!\" \"Is it possible that fate has treated you harshly? Is it possible that you can be unhappy with such a letter of commendation as nature has given you?\" \"Alas! let us speak of something else.

Since her flight nothing has been heard of her, and you see I have some reason to fear that she is unhappy. I would willingly give my life if it could be the saving of her. She and Sophie dined with me, and her father came in at the end of the meal. I heard that you had gone to Russia, and had fought a duel with a general in Poland. Is this true? How I wish I could tell dear Sophie all this, but I may not entertain such hopes now. \" \"You have heard the truth about me; but what should prevent you writing what you like to England?

       " \"Quirico, and the so–called Comte de l'Etoile came out and welcomed his wife in the most loving fashion, kissing her before everybody, no doubt with the object of giving people to understand that she was his wife, and I her father. The girl responded to all his caresses, looking as if a load had been lifted off her breast, and without a word of reproach she went upstairs with him, having apparently forgotten my existence. I set that down to love, youth, and the forgetfulness natural to that early age. I went upstairs in my turn with my carpet bag, and supper was served directly, as we had to start very early the next morning if we wished to reach Radicofani before the noonday heat. We had an excellent supper, as the count had preceded us by six hours, and the landlord had had plenty of time to make his preparations. The English girl seemed as much in love with de l'Etoile as he with her, and I was left completely out in the cold.\",\n",
       " 'I cannot describe the high spirits, the somewhat risky sallies, and the outrageous humours of the young gentleman; the girl laughed with all her heart, and I could not help laughing too. I considered that I was present at a kind of comedy, and not a gesture, not a word, not a laugh did I allow to escape me. \"He may be merely a rich and feather–brained young officer,\" I said to myself, \"who treats everything in this farcical manner. They are amusing, but frivolous, and sometimes dangerous, wearing their honour lightly, and too apt to carry it at the sword\\'s point. \" On this hypothesis I was ill pleased with my position. I did not much like his manner towards myself; he seemed to be making a dupe of me, and behaved all the while as if he were doing me an honour. On the supposition that the Englishwoman was his wife, his treatment of myself was certainly not warranted, and I was not the man to play zero.',\n",
       " 'I could not disguise the fact, however, that any onlooker would have pronounced me to be playing an inferior part. There were two beds in the room where we had our supper. When the chambermaid came to put on the sheets, I told her to give me another room. The count politely begged me to sleep in the same room with them, and the lady remained neutral; but I did not much care for their company, and insisted on leaving them alone. I had my carpet bag taken to my room, wished them a good night and locked myself in. My friends had only one small trunk, whence I concluded that they had sent on their luggage by another way; but they did not even have the trunk brought up to their room. I went to bed tranquilly, feeling much less interested about the lady than I had been on the journey. I was roused early in the morning, and made a hasty toilette. I could hear my neighbours dressing, so I half opened my door, and wished them good day without going into their room.',\n",

The vetturino held the horse\\'s bridle, and the pretended count did his best to snatch it away from him. I guessed the bone of contention: the Frenchman had no money, and the vetturino asked in vain for his due. I knew that I should be drawn into the dispute, and was making up my mind to do my duty without mercy, when the Count de l\\'Etoile came in and said,— \"This blockhead does not understand what I say to him; but as he may have right on his side, I must ask you to give him two sequins. By an odd chance I happen to have no money about me, but the fellow might trust me as he has got my trunk. However, he says he must be paid, so will you kindly oblige me? You shall hear more of me at Rome. \" Without waiting for me to reply, the rascal went out and ran down the stairs.',\n",
       " 'I put my head out of the window, and saw him leap on horseback and gallop away. I sat down on my bed, and turned the scene over in my mind, rubbing my hands gently. At last I went off into a mad roar of laughter; it struck me as so whimsical and original an adventure. \"Laugh too,\" said I to the lady, \"laugh or I will never get up. \" \"I agree with you that it\\'s laughable enough, but I have not the spirit to laugh. \" I gave the poor devil of a vetturino two sequins, telling him that I should like some coffee and to start in a quarter of an hour. \"I understand your grief,\" said I, \"but you must try to overcome it. I have only one favour to ask of you, and if you refuse to grant me that, I shall be as sad as you, so we shall be rather a melancholy couple. \" \"What can I do for you?\" \"You can tell me on your word of honour whether that extraordinary character is your husband, or only your lover. \" \"I will tell you the simple truth; he is not my husband, but we are going to be married at Rome.',\n",
       " 'He never shall be your husband, and so much the better for you. He has seduced you, and you love him, but you will soon get over that. I am sure he has told you that he is rich, that he is a man of rank, and that he will make you happy; and all that is a lie. \" \"How can you know all this?\" \"Experience—experience is my great teacher. Your lover is a young feather–brain, a man of no worth. He might possibly marry you, but it would be only to support himself by the sale of your charms. \" \"Yes, he loves you, but not with the love of a man of honour.

I am sorry that what I say makes you weep, but it must be said. I even dare tell you that I have taken a great liking to you; but you may feel quite sure that I shall not ask you to give me so much as a kiss, and I will never abandon you. Before we get to Rome I shall convince you that the count, as he calls himself, not only does not love you, but is a common swindler as well as a deceiver. \" \"You will convince me of that?\" \"Yes, on my word of honour! Dry your eyes, and let us try to make this day pass as pleasantly as yesterday. You cannot imagine how glad I feel that chance has constituted me your protector.',\n",
       " 'I want you to feel assured of my friendship, and if you do not give me a little love in return, I will try and bear it patiently. \" The landlord came in and brought the bill for the count and his mistress as well as for myself. I had expected this, and paid it without a word, and without looking at the poor wandering sheep beside me. I recollected that too strong medicines kill, and do not cure, and I was afraid I had said almost too much. I longed to know her history, and felt sure I should hear it before we reached Rome. We took some coffee and departed, and not a word passed between us till we got to the inn at La Scala, where we got down. The road from La Scala to Radicofani is steep and troublesome. The vetturino would require an extra horse, and even then would have taken four hours. I decided, therefore, to take two post horses, and not to begin the journey till ten o\\'clock. \"Would it not be better to go on now?\" said the English girl; \"it will be very hot from ten till noon.',\n",
       " '\" \"Yes, but the Comte de l\\'Ltoile, whom we should be sure to meet at Radicofani, would not like to see me. \" If I had told her my reason she would have wept anew, so in pity I spared her. I saw that she was blinded by love, and could not see the true character of her lover. It would be impossible to cure her by gentle and persuasive argument; I must speak sharply, the wound must be subjected to the actual cautery. But was virtue the cause of all this interest? Was it devotion to a young and innocent girl that made me willing to undertake so difficult and so delicate a task? Doubtless these motives went for something, but I will not attempt to strut in borrowed plumes, and must freely confess that if she had been ugly and stupid I should probably have left her to her fate. In short, selfishness was at the bottom of it all, so let us say no more about virtue. My true aim was to snatch this delicate morsel from another\\'s hand that I might enjoy it myself.',\n",
       " 'I did not confess as much to myself, for I could never bear to calmly view my own failings, but afterwards I came to the conclusion that I acted a part throughout. Is selfishness, then, the universal motor of our actions? I am afraid it is. I made Betty (such was her name) take a country walk with me, and the scenery there is so beautiful that no poet nor painter could imagine a more delicious prospect. Betty spoke Tuscan with English idioms and an English accent, but her voice was so silvery and clear that her Italian was delightful to listen to. I longed to kiss her lips as they spoke so sweetly, but I respected her and restrained myself. We were walking along engaged in agreeable converse, when all at once we heard the church bells peal out. Betty said she had never seen a Catholic service, and I was glad to give her that pleasure.',\n",
       " \"It was the feast day of some local saint, and Betty assisted at high mass with all propriety, imitating the gestures of the people, so that no one would have taken her for a Protestant. After it was over, she said she thought the Catholic rite was much more adapted to the needs of loving souls than the Angelican. She was astonished at the southern beauty of the village girls, whom she pronounced to be much handsomer that the country lasses in England. She asked me the time, and I replied without thinking that I wondered she had not got a watch. She blushed and said the count had asked her to give it him to leave in pawn for the horse he hired. I was sorry for what I had said, for I had put Betty, who was incapable of a lie, to great pain. We started at ten o'clock with three horses, and as a cool wind was blowing we had a pleasant drive, arriving at Radicofani at noon.\",\n",
       " 'The landlord, who was also the postmaster, asked if I would pay three pauls which the Frenchman had expended for his horse and himself, assuring the landlord that his friend would pay. For Betty\\'s sake I said I would pay; but this was not all. \"The gentleman,\" added the man, \"has beaten three of my postillions with his naked sword. One of them was wounded in the face, and he has followed his assailant, and will make him pay dearly for it. The reason of the assault was that they wanted to detain him till he had paid. \" \"You were wrong to allow violence to be used; he does not look like a thief, and you might have taken it for granted that I should pay. \" \"You are mistaken; I was not obliged to take anything of the sort for granted; I have been cheated in this sort many times before. She observed a distressed silence; and I tried to raise her spirits, and to make her eat a good dinner, and to taste the excellent Muscat, of which the host had provided an enormous flask.',\n",
       " 'All my efforts were in vain, so I called the vetturino to tell him that I wanted to start directly after dinner. \"You mean to go as far as Centino, I suppose,\" said the man. \" \"No, we must push on, as the lady\\'s husband may be in need of help. The wounded postillion has followed him; and as he speaks Italian very imperfectly, there\\'s no knowing what may happen to him. \" Betty looked at me with the utmost gratitude; and by way of proving it, she pretended to have a good appetite. She had noticed that this was a certain way of pleasing me. While we were at dinner I ordered up one of the beaten postillions, and heard his story. He was a frank rogue; he said he had received some blows with the flat of the sword, but he boasted of having sent a stone after the Frenchman which must have made an impression on him.',\n",
       " \"I gave him a Paul, and promised to make it a crown if he would go to Centino to bear witness against his comrade, and he immediately began to speak up for the count, much to Betty's amusement. He said the man's wound in the face was a mere scratch, and that he had brought it on himself, as he had no business to oppose a traveller as he had done. By way of comfort he told us that the Frenchman had only been hit by two or three stones. Betty did not find this very consoling, but I saw that the affair was more comic than tragic, and would end in nothing. The postillion went off, and we followed him in half an hour. Betty was tranquil enough till we got there, and heard that the count had gone on to Acquapendente with the two postillions at his heels; she seemed quite vexed. I told her that all would be well; that the count knew how to defend himself; but she only answered me with a deep sigh.\",\n",
       " 'I suspected that she was afraid we should have to pass the night together, and that I would demand some payment for all the trouble I had taken. \"Would you like us to go on to Acquapendente?\" I asked her. At this question her face beamed all over; she opened her arms, and I embraced her. The fellow replied that his horses were in the stable, and that he was not going to put them in; but that I could have post horses if I liked. \" It is my belief that, if I had liked, Betty would have given me everything at that moment, for she let herself fall into my arms. I pressed her tenderly and kissed her, and that was all She seemed grateful for my self–restraint. The horses were put in, and after I had paid the landlord for the supper, which he swore he had prepared for us, we started. We reached Acquapendente in three quarters of an hour, and we found the madcap count in high spirits. He embraced his Dulcinea with transports, and Betty seemed delighted to find him safe and sound.',\n",
       " 'He told us triumphantly that he had beaten the rascally postillions, and had warded their stones off. \"He is drinking to my health with his comrade; they have both begged my pardon. \" \"Yes,\" said Betty, \"this gentleman gave him a crown. \" \"What a pity! You shouldn\\'t have given them anything. \" Before supper the Comte de l\\'Etoile skewed us the bruises on his thighs and side; the rascal was a fine well–made fellow. However, Betty\\'s adoring airs irritated me, though I was consoled at the thought of the earnest I had received from her. Next day, the impudent fellow told me that he would order us a good supper at Viterbo, and that of course I would lend him a sequin to pay for his dinner at Montefiascone. So saying, he skewed me in an off–hand way a bill of exchange on Rome for three thousand crowns. I did not trouble to read it, and gave him the sequin, though I felt sure I should never see it again. Betty now treated me quite confidentially, and I felt I might ask her almost any questions.',\n",
       " 'When we were at Montefiascone she said,— \"You see my lover is only without money by chance; he has a bill of exchange for a large amount. \" \"Not at all; I only wish I were mistaken, but I am sure of the contrary. Twenty years ago I should have taken it for a good one, but now it\\'s another thing, and if the bill is a good one, why did he not negotiate it at Sienna, Florence, or Leghorn?\" \"It may be that he had not the time; he was in such a hurry to be gone. Ah! if you knew all!\" \"I only want to know what you like to tell me, but I warn you again that what I say is no vague suspicion but hard fact. \" \"Then you persist in the idea that he does not love me. \" \"Nay, he loves you, but in such a fashion as to deserve hatred in return. \" \"How do you mean?\" \"Would you not hate a man who loved you only to traffic in your charms?\" \"I should be sorry for you to think that of him. \" \"If you like, I will convince you of what I say this evening.',\n",
       " '\" \"You will oblige me; but I must have some positive proof. It would be a sore pain to me, but also a true service. \" \"And when you are convinced, will you cease to love him?\" \"Certainly; if you prove him to be dishonest, my love will vanish away. \" \"You are mistaken; you will still love him, even when you have had proof positive of his wickedness. He has evidently fascinated you in a deadly manner, or you would see his character in its true light before this. \" \"All this may be true; but do you give me your proofs, and leave to me the care of shewing that I despise him. \" \"I will prove my assertions this evening; but tell me how long you have known him?\" \"About a month; but we have only been together for five days. \" \"And before that time you never accorded him any favours?\" \"Not a single kiss. He was always under my windows, and I had reason to believe that he loved me fondly.',\n",
       " '\" \"Oh, yes! he loves you, who would not? but his love is not that of a man of honour, but that of an impudent profligate. \" \"But how can you suspect a man of whom you know nothing?\" \"Would that I did not know him! I feel sure that not being able to visit you, he made you visit him, and then persuaded you to fly with him. \" \"And who is to answer for his constancy?\" \"His love is my surety. \" \"Did he take you from a father, a lover, or a brother?\" \"From a lover, who will not be back at Leghorn for a week or ten days. \" \"Where has he gone?\" \"To London on business; I was under the charge of a woman whom he trusted. Tell me if you love your Englishman, and if he is worthy of your love. \" \"Alas! I loved him dearly till I saw this Frenchman, who made me unfaithful to a man I adored. He will be in despair at not finding me when he returns. \" \"Is he rich?\" \"Not very; he is a business man, and is comfortably off. He is a man of your age, and a thoroughly kind and honest person.',\n",
       " 'He was waiting for his consumptive wife to die to marry me. \" \"Poor man! Have you presented him with a child?\" \"No. I am sure God did not mean me for him, for the count has conquered me completely. \" \"Everyone whom love leads astray says the same thing. \" \"Now you have heard everything, and I am glad I told you, for I am sure you are my friend. \" \"I will be a better friend to you, dear Betty, in the future than in the past. You will need my services, and I promise not to abandon you. I love you, as I have said; but so long as you continue to love the Frenchman I shall only ask you to consider me as your friend. \" \"I accept your promise, and in return I promise not to hide anything from you. \" \"I escaped on horseback, but my trunk, which is full of linen and other effects, will be at Rome two days after us. I sent it off the day before my escape, and the man who received it was sent by the count.',\n",
       " '\" \"Then good–bye to your trunk!\" \"Why, you foresee nothing but misfortune!\" \"Well, dear Betty, I only wish my prophecies may not be accomplished. Although you escaped on horseback I think you should have brought a cloak and a carpet bag with some linen. \" \"All that is in the small trunk; I shall have it taken into my room tonight. \" We reached Viterbo at seven o\\'clock, and found the count very cheerful. In accordance with the plot I had laid against the count, I began by shewing myself demonstratively fond of Betty, envying the fortunate lover, praising his heroic behaviour in leaving her to me, and so forth. The silly fellow proceeded to back me up in my extravagant admiration. He boasted that jealousy was utterly foreign to his character, and maintained that the true lover would accustom himself to see his mistress inspire desires in other men.',\n",
       " 'He proceeded to make a long dissertation on this theme, and I let him go on, for I was waiting till after supper to come to the conclusive point. During the meal I made him drink, and applauded his freedom from vulgar prejudices. At dessert he enlarged on the duty of reciprocity between lovers. \"Thus,\" he remarked, \"Betty ought to procure me the enjoyment of Fanny, if she has reason to think I have taken a fancy to her; and per contra, as I adore Betty, if I found that she loved you I should procure her the pleasure of sleeping with you. \" Betty listened to all this nonsense in silent astonishment. \"I confess, my dear count,\" I replied, \"that, theoretically speaking, your system strikes me as sublime, and calculated to bring about the return of the Golden Age; but I am afraid it would prove absurd in practice. No doubt you are a man of courage, but I am sure you would never let your mistress be enjoyed by another man.',\n",
       " 'I will wager that amount that you will not allow me to sleep with your wife. I\\'ll bet fifty sequins that I will remain in the room a calm spectator of your exploits. My dear Betty, we must punish this sceptic; go to bed with him. \" \"Not at all; to bed with you, I shall love you all the more. \" \"You must be crazy, I shall do nothing of the kind. \" The count took her in his arms, and caressing her in the tenderest manner begged her to do him this favour, not so much for the twenty–five Louis, as to convince me that he was above vulgar prejudices. His caresses became rather free, but Betty repulsed him gently though firmly, saying that she would never consent, and that he had already won the bet, which was the case; in fine the poor girl besought him to kill her rather than oblige her to do a deed which she thought infamous. Her words, and the pathetic voice with which they were uttered, should have shamed him, but they only put him into a furious rage.',\n",
       " \"He repulsed her, calling her the vilest names, and finally telling her that she was a hypocrite, and he felt certain she had already granted me all a worthless girl could grant. Betty grew pale as death, and furious in my turn, I ran for my sword. I should probably have run him through, if the infamous scoundrel had not fled into the next room, where he locked himself in. I was in despair at seeing Betty's distress, of which I had been the innocent cause, and I did my best to soothe her. Her breath came with difficulty, her eyes seemed ready to start out of her head, her lips were bloodless and trembling, and her teeth shut tight together. I could not call for help, and all I could do was to dash water in her face, and speak soothing words. At last she fell asleep, and I remained beside her for more than two hours, attentive to her least movements, and hoping that she would awake strengthened and refreshed. At day–break I heard l'Etoile going off, and I was glad of it.\",\n",
       " 'The people of the inn knocked at our door, and then Betty awoke. \"Are you ready to go, my dear Betty?\" \"I am much better, but I should so like a cup of tea. \" The Italians cannot make tea, so I took what she gave me, and went to prepare it myself. When I came back I found her inhaling the fresh morning air at the window. She drank a few cups of tea (of which beverage the English are very fond), and soon regained her good looks. She heard some people in the room where we had supped, and asked me if I had taken up the purse which I had placed on the table. I found my purse and a piece of paper bearing the words, \"bill of exchange for three thousand crowns. \" The impostor had taken it out of his pocket in making his bet, and had forgotten it. It was dated at Bordeaux, drawn on a wine merchant at Paris to l\\'Etoile\\'s order. I took it to Betty, who told me she knew nothing about bills, and begged me to say nothing more about that infamous fellow.',\n",
       " 'She then said, in a voice of which I can give no idea,— \"For pity\\'s sake do not abandon a poor girl, more worthy of compassion than blame!\" I promised her again to have all a father\\'s care for her, and soon after we proceeded on our journey. The poor girl fell asleep, and I followed her example. We were awoke by the vetturino who informed us, greatly to our astonishment, that we were at Monterosi. We had slept for six hours, and had done eighteen miles. We had to stay at Monterosi till four o\\'clock, and we were glad of it, for we needed time for reflection. In the first place I asked about the wretched deceiver, and was told that he had made a slight meal, paid for it, and said he was going to spend the night at La Storta. We made a good dinner, and Betty plucking up a spirit said we must consider the case of her infamous betrayer, but for the last time. \"Be a father to me,\" said she; \"do not advise but command; you may reckon on my obedience.',\n",
       " 'I have no need to give you any further particulars, for you have guessed all except the horror with which the thought of my betrayer now inspires me. If it had not been for you, he would have plunged me into an abyss of shame and misery. \" \"Can you reckon on the Englishman forgiving you?\" \"I think so. Are you strong enough to follow this counsel? I warn you that if you approve of it, it must be put into execution at once. Young, pretty, and virtuous as you are, you need not imagine that I shall allow you to go by yourself, or in the company of strangers. If you think I love you, and find me worthy of your esteem, that is sufficient regard for me. I will live with you like a father, if you are not in a position to give me marks of a more ardent affection. Be sure I will keep faith with you, for I want to redeem your opinion of men, and to shew you that there are men as honourable as your seducer was vile.',\n",
       " '\" Betty remained for a quarter of an hour in profound silence, her head resting on her elbows, and her eyes fixed on mine. She did not seem either angry or astonished, but as far as I could judge was lost in thought. I was glad to see her reflective, for thus she would be able to give me a decided answer: At last she said: \"You need not think, my dear friend, that my silence proceeds from irresolution. If my mind were not made up already I should despise myself. I am wise enough at any rate to appreciate the wisdom of your generous counsels. I thank Providence that I have fallen into the hands of such a man who will treat me as if I were his daughter. \" \"Then we will go back to Leghorn, and start immediately. \" \"My only doubt is how to manage my reconciliation with Sir B― M―. I have no doubt he will pardon me eventually; but though he is tender and good–hearted he is delicate where a point of honour is concerned, and Subject to sudden fits of violence.',\n",
       " 'This is what I want to avoid; for he might possibly kill me, and then I should be the cause of his ruin. \" \"You must consider it on the way, and tell me any plans you may think of. \" \"He is an intelligent man, and it would be hopeless to endeavour to dupe him by a lie. I must make a full confession in writing without hiding a single circumstance; for if he thought he was being duped his fury would be terrible. If you will write to him you must not say that you think me worthy of forgiveness; you must tell him the facts and leave him to judge for himself. He will be convinced of my repentance when he reads the letter I shall bedew with my tears, but he must not know of my whereabouts till he has promised to forgive me. He is a slave to his word of honour, and we shall live together all our days without my ever hearing of this slip. \" \"You must not be offended if I ask you whether you have ever given him like cause for complaint before.',\n",
       " '\" \"What is his history?\" \"He lived very unhappily with his first wife; and he was divorced from his second wife for sufficient reasons. Two years ago he came to our school with Nancy\\'s father, and made my acquaintance. My father died, his creditors seized everything, and I had to leave the school, much to Nancy\\'s distress and that of the other pupils. At this period Sir B― M― took charge of me, and gave me a sum which placed me beyond the reach of, want for the rest of my days. I was grateful, and begged him to take me with him when he told me he was leaving England. He was astonished; and, like a man of honour, said he loved me too well to flatter himself that we could travel together without his entertaining more ardent feelings for me than those of a father. He thought it out of the question for me to love him, save as a daughter. \"This declaration, as you may imagine, paved the way for a full agreement.',\n",
       " '\" \"\\'However you love me,\\' I said, \\'I shall be well pleased, and if I can do anything for you I shall be all the happier. \\' \"He then gave me of his own free will a written promise to marry me on the death of his wife. We started on our travels, and till my late unhappy connection I never gave him the slightest cause for complaint. \" \"Dry your eyes, dear Betty, he is sure to forgive you. I have friends at Leghorn, and no one shall find out that we have made acquaintance. I will put you in good hands, and I shall not leave the town till I hear you are back with Sir B― M―. If he prove inexorable I promise never to abandon you, and to take you back to England if you like. \" \"But how can you spare the time?\" \"I will tell you the truth, my dear Betty. I have nothing particular to do at Rome, or anywhere else. \" \"How can I shew my gratitude to you?\" I summoned the vetturino, and told him we must return to Viterbo.',\n",
       " \"He objected, but I convinced him with a couple of piastres, and by agreeing to use the post horses and to spare his own animals. We got to Viterbo by seven o'clock, and asked anxiously if no one had found a pocket–book which I pretended I had lost. I was told no such thing had been found, so I ordered supper with calmness, although bewailing my loss. I told Betty that I acted in this sort to obviate any difficulties which the vetturino might make about taking us back to Sienna, as he might feel it his duty to place her in the hands of her supposed husband. I had up the small trunk, and after we had forced the lock Betty took out her cloak and the few effects she had in it, and we then inspected the adventurer's properties, most likely all he possessed in the world.\",\n",
       " 'A few tattered shirts, two or three pairs of mended silk stockings, a pair of breeches, a hare\\'s foot, a pot of grease, and a score of little books–plays or comic operas, and lastly a packet of letters; such were the contents of the trunk. We proceeded to read the letters, and the first thing we noted was the address: \"To M. L\\'Etoile, Actor, at Marseilles, Bordeaux, Bayonne, Montpellier, etc. She saw herself the dupe of a vile actor, and her indignation and shame were great. \"We will read it all to–morrow,\" said I; \"to–day we have something else to do. We got over our supper hastily, and then Betty begged me to leave her alone for a few moments for her to change her linen and go to bed. \"If you like,\" said I, \"I will have a bed made up for me in the next room.',\n",
       " '\" \"No, dear friend, ought I not to love your society? What would have become of me without you?\" I went out for a few minutes, and when I returned and came to her bedside to wish her good night, she gave me such a warm embrace that I knew my hour was come. I was happy, and I had reason to believe that Betty was happy also. In the morning, we had just fallen asleep, when the vettuyino knocked at the door. \"Listen,\" I said, \"it is absolutely necessary for me to recover my pocket–book, and I hope to find it at Acquapendente. \" \"Very good, sir, very good,\" said the rogue, a true Italian, \"pay me as if I had taken you to Rome, and a sequin a day for the future, and if you like, I will take you to England on those terms. \" The vetturino was evidently what is called wide awake. At seven o\\'clock we stopped at Montefiascone to write to Sir B― M―, she in English, and I in French. Betty had now an air of satisfaction and assurance which I found charming.',\n",
       " 'She said she was full of hope, and seemed highly amused at the thought of the figure which the actor would cut when he arrived at Rome by himself. She hoped that we should come across the man in charge of her trunk, and that we should have no difficulty in getting it back. \" \"I expect not, but if he does I will give him a warm welcome. If he does not take himself off I will blow out his brains. \"Not even the reward you gave me?\" \"Oh, yes! That is a little secret between ourselves. \" In less than three hours the letters were composed and written. Betty was satisfied with my letter; and her own, which she translated for my benefit, was a perfect masterpiece of sensibility, which seemed to me certain of success. I thought of posting from Sienna, to ensure her being in a place of safety before the arrival of her lover.',\n",
       " \"The only thing that troubled me was the bill of exchange left behind by l'Etoile, for whether it were true or false, I felt bound to deal with it in some way, but I could not see how it was to be done. We set out again after dinner in spite of the heat, and arrived at Acquapendente in the evening and spent the night in the delights of mutual love. As I was getting up in the morning I saw a carriage in front of the inn, just starting for Rome. I imagined that amidst the baggage Betty's trunk might be discovered, and I told her to get up, and see if it were there. We went down, and Betty recognized the trunk she had confided to her seducer. We begged the vetturino to restore it to us, but he was inflexible; and as he was in the right we had to submit. The only thing he could do was to have an embargo laid on the trunk at Rome, the said embargo to last for a month. A notary was called, and our claim properly drawn up.\",\n",
       " 'The vetturino, who seemed an honest and intelligent fellow, assured us he had received nothing else belonging to the Comte de l\\'Etoile, so we were assured that the actor was a mere beggar on the lookout for pickings, and that the rags in the small trunk were all his possessions. After this business had been dispatched Betty brightened up amazingly. My mistake will serve as a warning to me for the future, for the lesson has been a severe one, and might have been much worse if I had not had the good fortune of meeting you. \" \"I congratulate you,\" I replied, \"on having cured yourself so quickly of a passion that had deprived you of your reason. I shudder when I think of the monster; but I verily believe that I should not have regained my senses if he had not called me a hypocrite, and said that he was certain I had already granted you my favours. These infamous words opened my eyes, and made me see my shame.',\n",
       " 'I believe I would have helped you to pierce him to the heart if the coward had not run away. But I am glad he did run away, not for his sake but for ours, for we should have been in an unpleasant position if he had been killed. \" \"You are right; he escaped my sword because he is destined for the rope. \" \"Let him look to that himself, but I am sure he will never dare to shew his face before you or me again. \" We reached Radicofani at ten o\\'clock, and proceeded to write postscripts to our letters to Sir B― M― We were sitting at the same table, Betty opposite to the door and I close to it, so that anyone coming in could not have seen me without turning round. Betty was dressed with all decency and neatness, but I had taken off my coat on account of the suffocating heat. Nevertheless, though I was in shirt sleeves, I should not have been ashamed of my attire before the most respectable woman in Italy. All at once I heard a rapid step coming along the passage, and the door was dashed open.',\n",
       " 'A furious–looking man came in, and, seeing Betty, cried out,— \"Ah! there you are. \" I did not give him time to turn round and see me, but leapt upon him and seized him by the shoulders. If I had not done so he would have shot me dead on the spot. As I leapt upon him I had involuntarily closed the door, and as he cried, \"Let me go, traitor!\" Betty fell on her knees before him, exclaiming, \"No, no! he is my preserver. \" Sir B― M― was too mad with rage to pay any attention to her, and kept on,― \"Let me go, traitors!\" As may be imagined, I did not pay much attention to this request so long as the loaded pistol was in his hand. In our struggles he at last fell to the ground and I on top of him. The landlord and his people had heard the uproar, and were trying to get in; but as we had fallen against the door they could not do so. Betty had the presence of mind to snatch the pistol from his hand, and I then let him go, calmly observing, \"Sir, you are labouring under a delusion.',\n",
       " '\" Again Betty threw herself on her knees, begging him to calm himself, as I was her preserver not her betrayer. \"What do you mean by \\'preserver\\'?\" said B― M― Betty gave him the letter, saying,— \"Read that. \" The Englishman read the letter through without rising from the ground, and as I was certain of its effect I opened the door and told the landlord to send his people away, and to get dinner for three, as everything had been settled.']"

After this he no doubt left the town on foot, for he was seen no more. Now the reader is in a position to understand my surprise and amusement, when, one day as I peered through the grating in my dungeon, I saw the oculist Tadini standing over me with gun in hand. But he at all events evinced no amusement whatever, while I roared and roared again with laughter for the two hours his duty lasted. I gave him a good meal and a sufficiency of my excellent wine, and at the end a crown, promising that he should have the same treatment every time he returned to the post. But I only saw him four times, as the guard at my cell was a position eagerly coveted and intrigued for by the other soldiers. He amused me by the story of his misadventures since he had left Warsaw.\n",

I tried vainly to find Hannibal's head, and the inscription in honour of Caesar Claudius, but I found out the remains of the amphitheatre. The next day I remarked the mosaic pavement, which had been discovered twenty years before. I reached Valentia at nine o'clock in the morning, and found that I should have to content myself with a bad lodging, as Marescalchi, the opera manager, had taken all the best rooms for the members of his company. Marescalchi was accompanied by his brother, a priest, whom I found decidedly learned for his age. We took a walk together, and he laughed when I proposed going into a cafe, for there was not such a thing in the town. There were only taverns of the lowest class where the wine is not fit to drink.\n",

I guessed something of her secret, and begged pardon; and for more than an hour I remain silent, pretending to gaze at the scenery, but in reality thinking of her, for she began to inspire me with a lively interest. Though the position of my young companion was more than equivocal, I determined to see my way clearly before I took any decisive step; and I waited patiently till we got to Bon Couvent, where we expected to dine and meet the husband. In Italy the carriages never go faster than a walk; a man on foot can outstrip them, as they rarely exceed three miles an hour.\n",

Is selfishness, then, the universal motor of our actions? I am afraid it is. I made Betty (such was her name) take a country walk with me, and the scenery there is so beautiful that no poet nor painter could imagine a more delicious prospect. Betty spoke Tuscan with English idioms and an English accent, but her voice was so silvery and clear that her Italian was delightful to listen to. I longed to kiss her lips as they spoke so sweetly, but I respected her and restrained myself. We were walking along engaged in agreeable converse, when all at once we heard the church bells peal out. Betty said she had never seen a Catholic service, and I was glad to give her that pleasure.\n"

       "'\" She called her sister, and told her to order the Genoese to leave the house and never to enter it again. The thing was \\'done in a moment, but the sister told us that as he went out he had said,— \"Se ne pentira. I occupied an hour in relating some of the injuries I had received from this scoundrelly fellow. The next day (November 15th), I went to Nina at the usual time, and after spending two hours in pleasant converse with her and her sister I went out as the clocks were striking midnight. The door of the house was under an arcade, which extended to the end of the street. It was a dark night; and I had scarcely gone twenty–five paces when two men suddenly rushed at me. I stepped back, drawing my sword, and exclaiming, \"Assassins!\" and then with a rapid movement, I thrust my blade into the body of the nearest assailant. I then left the arcade, and began to run down the street. The second assassin fired a pistol at me, but it fortunately missed me.'"

       " 'Chapter I I Make a Mistake and Manucci Becomes My Mortal Foe--his Vengeance--i Leave Madrid--saragossa--valentia--nina--i Arrive at Barcelona If these Memoirs, only written to console me in the dreadful weariness which is slowly killing me in Bohemia—and which, perhaps, would kill me anywhere, since, though my body is old, my spirit and my desires are as young as ever—if these Memoirs are ever read, I repeat, they will only be read when I am gone, and all censure will be lost on me. Nevertheless, seeing that men are divided into two sections, the one and by far the greater composed of the ignorant and superficial, and the other of the learned and reflective, I beg to state that it is to the latter I would appeal. Their judgment, I believe, will be in favour of my veracity, and, indeed, why should I not be veracious? A man can have no object in deceiving himself, and it is for myself that I chiefly write.',\n",
       " \"Hitherto I have spoken nothing but the truth, without considering whether the truth is in my favour or no. My book is not a work of dogmatic theology, but I do not think it will do harm to anyone; while I fancy that those who know how to imitate the bee and to get honey from every flower will be able to extract some good from the catalogue of my vices and virtues. After this digression (it may be too long, but that is my business and none other's), I must confess that never have I had so unpleasant a truth to set down as that which I am going to relate. I committed a fatal act of indiscretion—an act which after all these years still gives my heart a pang as I think of it. The day after my conquest I dined with the Venetian ambassador, and I had the pleasure of hearing that all the ministers and grandees with whom I had associated had the highest possible opinion of me.\",\n",
       " 'In three or four days the king, the royal family, and the ministers would return to town, and I expected to have daily conferences with the latter respecting the colony in the Sierra Morena, where I should most probably be going. Manucci, who continued to treat me as a valued friend, proposed to accompany me on my journey, and would bring with him an adventuress, who called herself Porto–Carrero, pretending to be the daughter or niece of the late cardinal of that name, and thus obtained a good deal of consideration; though in reality she was only the mistress of the French consul at Madrid, the Abbe Bigliardi. Such was the promising state of my prospects when my evil genius brought to Madrid a native of Liege, Baron de Fraiture, chief huntsman of the principality, and a profligate, a gamester, and a cheat, like all those who proclaim their belief in his honesty nowadays. I had unfortunately met him at Spa, and told him I was was going to Portugal.',\n",
       " 'He had come after me, hoping to use me as a means of getting into good society, and of filling his pocket with the money of the dupes he aspired to make. Gamesters have never had any proof of my belonging to their infernal clique, but they have always persisted in believing that I too am a \"Greek. \" As soon as this baron heard that I was in Madrid he called on me, and by dint of politeness obliged me to receive him. I thought any small civilities I might shew or introductions I might give could do me no harm. He had a travelling companion to whom he introduced me. He was a fat, ignorant fellow, but a Frenchman, and therefore agreeable. A Frenchman who knows how to present himself, who is well dressed, and has the society air, is usually accepted without demur or scrutiny. He had been a cavalry captain, but had been fortunate enough to obtain an everlasting furlough. Four or five days after his appearance the baron asked me quietly enough to lend him a score of louis, as he was hard up.',\n",
       " 'I replied as quietly, thanking him for treating me as a friend, but informing him that I really could not lend him the money, as I wanted what little I had for my own necessities. \"But we can do good business together, and you cannot possibly be moneyless. \" \"I do not know anything about good business, but I do know that I want my money and cannot part with it. \" \"We are at our wits\\' end to quiet our landlord; come and speak to him. \" \"If I were to do so I should do you more harm than good. He would ask me if I would answer for you, and I should reply that you are one of those noblemen who stand in need of no surety. All the same, the landlord would think that if I did not stand your surety, it must be from my entertaining doubts as to your solvency. \" I had introduced Fraiture to Count Manucci, on the Pando, and he requested me to take him to see the count, to which request I was foolish enough to accede. A few days later the baron opened his soul to Manucci.',\n",
       " 'He found the Venetian disposed to be obliging, but wary. He refused to lend money himself, but introduced the baron to someone who lent him money on pledges without interest. The baron and his friend did a little gaming and won a little money, but I held aloof from them to the best of my ability. I had my colony and Donna Ignazia, and wanted to live peacefully; and if I had spent a single night away from home, the innocent girl would have been filled with alarm. de Mocenigo went as ambassador to France, and was replaced by M. Querini was a man of letters, while Mocenigo only liked music and his own peculiar kind of love. The new ambassador was distinctly favourable to me, and in a few days I had reason to believe that he would do more for me than ever Mocenigo would have done. In the meanwhile, the baron and his friend began to think of beating a retreat to France.',\n",
       " 'There was no gaming at the ambassador\\'s and no gaming at the Court; they must return to France, but they owed money to their landlord, and they wanted money for the journey. I could give them nothing, Manucci would give them nothing; we both pitied them, but our duty to ourselves made us cruel to everyone else. One morning Manucci came to see me in evident perturbation. For the last week I have refused to see the Baron Fraiture, as not being able to give him money, his presence only wearied me. He has written me a letter, in which he threatens to blow out his brains to–day if I will not lend him a hundred pistoles. \" \"He said the same thing to me three days ago; but I replied that I would bet two hundred pistoles that he would do nothing of the kind. This made him angry, and he proposed to fight a duel with me; but I declined on the plea that as he was a desperate man either he would have an advantage over me or I, over him. Give him the same answer, or, better still, no answer at all.',\n",
       " '\" I admired his generosity and agreed to carry out his commission. I called on the baron, who seemed rather uncomfortable when I walked in; but considering his position I was not at all surprised. I informed him that I was the bearer of a thousand francs from Count Manucci, who thereby placed him in a position to arrange his affairs and to leave Madrid. He received the money without any signs of pleasure, surprise, or gratitude, and wrote out the receipt. He assured me that he and his friend would start for Barcelona and France on the following day. I then took the document to Manucci, who was evidently suffering from some mental trouble; and I remained to dinner with the ambassador. Three days after I went to dine with the ambassadors (for they all dined together), but to my astonishment the porter told me that he had received orders not to admit me. The effect of this sentence on me was like that of a thunderbolt; I returned home like a man in a dream.',\n",
       " 'I immediately sat down and wrote to Manucci, asking him why I had been subjected to such an insult; but Philippe, my man, brought me back the letter unopened. This was another surprise; I did not know what to expect next. \"I cannot imagine, but I will have an explanation, or perish. \" I dined sadly with Donna Ignazia, without telling her the cause of my trouble, and just as I was going to take my siesta a servant of Manucci\\'s brought me a letter from his master and fled before I could read it. The letter contained an enclosure which I read first. He asked Manucci to lend him a hundred pistoles, promising to shew him the man whom he held for his dearest friend to be his worst enemy. Manucci (honouring me, by the way, with the title of ungrateful traitor) said that the baron\\'s letter had excited his curiosity and he had met him in St.',\n",
       " \"Jerome's Park, where the baron had clearly proved this enemy to be myself, since I had informed the baron that though the name of Manucci was genuine the title of count was quite apocryphal. After recapitulating the information which Fraiture had given him, and which could only have proceeded from myself, he advised me to leave Madrid as soon as possible, in a week at latest. I can give the reader no idea of the shock this letter gave me. For the first time in my life I had to confess myself guilty of folly, ingratitude, and crime. I felt that my fault was beyond forgiveness, and did not think of asking Manucci to pardon me; I could do nothing but despair. Nevertheless, in spite of Manucci's just indignation, I could not help seeing that he had made a great mistake in advising me, in so insulting a manner, to leave Madrid in a week. The young man might have known that my self–respect would forbid my following such a piece of advice.\",\n",
       " 'He could not compel me to obey his counsel or command; and to leave Madrid would have been to commit a second baseness worse than the first. A prey to grief I spent the day without taking any steps one way or the other, and I went to bed without supping and without the company of Donna Ignazia. After a sound sleep I got up and wrote to the friend whom I had offended a sincere and humble confession of my fault. I concluded my letter by saying that I hoped that this evidence of my sincere and heartfelt repentance would suffice, but if not that I was ready to give him any honourable satisfaction in my power. \"You may,\" I said, \"have me assassinated if you like, but I shall not leave Madrid till its suits me to do so. \" I put a commonplace seal on my letter, and had the address written by Philippe, whose hand was unknown to Manucci, and then I sent it to Pando where the king had gone.',\n",
       " 'I kept my room the whole day; and Donna Ignazia, seeing that I had recovered my spirits to some degree, made no more enquiries about the cause of my distress. I waited in the whole of the next day, expecting a reply, but in vain. The third day, being Sunday, I went out to call on the Prince della Catolica. My carriage stopped at his door, but the porter came out and told me in a polite whisper that his highness had his reasons for not receiving me any longer. This was an unexpected blow, but after it I was prepared for anything. I drove to the Abbe Bigliardi, but the lackey, after taking in my name, informed me that his master was out. I got into my carriage and went to Varnier, who said he wanted to speak to me. \"Come into my carriage,\" said I, \"we will go and hear mass together. \" On our way he told me that the Venetian ambassador, Mocenigo, had warned the Duke of Medina Sidonia that I was a dangerous character.',\n",
       " '\"The duke,\" he added, \"replied that he would cease to know you as soon as he found out the badness of your character himself. \" These three shocks, following in such quick succession, cast me into a state of confusion. I said nothing till we heard mass together, but I believe that if I had not then told him the whole story I should have had an apoplectic fit. Varnier pitied me, and said,— \"Such are the ways of the great when they have abjured all virtue and honesty. Nevertheless, I advise you to keep silence about it, unless you would irritate Manucci still farther. \" When I got home I wrote to Manucci begging him to suspend his vengeance, or else I should be obliged to tell the story to all those who insulted me for the ambassador\\'s sake. Soderini, the secretary of the embassy, feeling sure that he would forward it to Manucci.',\n",
       " 'I dined with my mistress, and took her to the bull fight, where I chanced to find myself in a box adjoining that in which Manucci and the two ambassadors were seated. I made them a bow which they were obliged to return, and did not vouchsafe them another glance for the rest of the spectacle. The next day the Marquis Grimaldi refused to receive me, and I saw that I should have to abandon all hope. The Duke of Lossada remained my friend on account of his dislike to the ambassador and his unnatural tastes; but he told me that he had been requested not to receive me, and that he did not think I had the slightest chance of obtaining any employment at Court. I could scarcely believe in such an extremity of vengeance: Manucci was making a parade of the influence he possessed over his wife the ambassador. In his insane desire for revenge he had laid all shame aside.',\n",
       " 'I was curious to know whether he had forgotten Don Emmanuel de Roda and the Marquis de la Moras; I found both of them had been forewarned against me. There was still the Count of Aranda, and I was just going to see him when a servant of his highness\\'s came and told me that his master wished to see me. I shuddered, for in my then state of mind I drew the most sinister conclusions from the message. I found the great man alone, looking perfectly calm. He asked me to sit down—a favour he had not hitherto done me, and this further contributed to cheer me. \"What have you been doing to offend your ambassador?\" he began. \"My lord, I have done nothing to him directly, but by an inexcusable act of stupidity I have wounded his dear friend Manucci in his tenderest part. With the most innocent intentions I reposed my confidence in a cowardly fellow, who sold it to Manucci for a hundred pistoles. In his irritation, Manucci has stirred up the great man against me: \\'hinc illae lacrimae\\'.',\n",
       " 'I am sorry for you, because there is an end to all your hopes of advancement. The first thing the king would do would be to make enquiries about you of the ambassador. \" \"I feel it to my sorrow, my lord, but must I leave Madrid?\" \"No. The ambassador did his best to make me send you way, but I told him that I had no power over you so long as you did not infringe the laws. \" \"\\'He has calumniated a Venetian subject whom I am bound to protect,\\' said he. \"\\'In that case,\\' I replied, \\'you can resort to the ordinary law, and punish him to the best of your ability. \\'\" \"The ambassador finally begged me to order you not to mention the matter to any Venetian subjects at Madrid, and I think you can safely promise me this. \" \"My lord, I have much pleasure in giving your excellency my word of honour not to do so. Then you can stay at Madrid as long as you please; and, indeed, Mocenigo will be leaving in the course of a week.',\n",
       " '\" From that moment I made up my mind to amuse myself without any thought of obtaining a position in Spain. However, the ties of friendship made me keep up my acquaintance with Varnier, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, and the architect, Sabatini, who always gave me a warm welcome, as did his wife. Donna Ignazia had more of my company than ever, and congratulated me on my freedom from the cares of business. After the departure of Mocenigo I thought I would go and see if Querini, his nephew, was equally prejudiced against me. The porter told me that he had received orders not to admit me, and I laughed in the man\\'s face. Six or seven weeks after Manucci\\'s departure I, too, left Madrid. I did so on compulsion, in spite of my love for Ignazia, for I had no longer hopes of doing anything in Portugal, and my purse was nearly exhausted.',\n",
       " 'I thought of selling a handsome repeater and a gold snuff–box so as to enable me to go to Marseilles, whence I thought of going to Constantinople and trying my fortune there without turning renegade. Doubtless, I should have found the plan unsuccessful, for I was attaining an age when Fortune flies. I had no reason, however, to complain of Fortune, for she had been lavish in her gifts to me, and I in my turn had always abused them. In my state of distress the learned Abbe Pinzi introduced me to a Genoese bookseller, named Carrado, a thoroughly honest man, who seemed to have been created that the knavery of most of the Genoese might be pardoned. To him I brought my watch and snuff–box, but the worthy Carrado not only refused to buy them, but would not take them in pledge. He gave me seventeen hundred francs with no other security than my word that I would repay him if I were ever able to do so.',\n",
       " 'Unhappily I have never been able to repay this debt, unless my gratitude be accounted repayment. As nothing is sweeter than the companionship between a man and the woman he adores, so nothing is bitterer than the separation; the pleasure has vanished away, and only the pain remains. I spent my last days at Madrid drinking the cup of pleasure which was embittered by the thought of the pain that was to follow. The worthy Diego was sad at the thought of losing me, and could with difficulty refrain from tears. For some time my man Philippe continued to give me news of Donna Ignazia. She became the bride of a rich shoemaker, though her father was extremely mortified by her making a marriage so much beneath her station. I had promised the Marquis de las Moras and Colonel Royas that I would come and see them at Saragossa, the capital of Aragon, and I arrived there at the beginning of September.',\n",
       " 'My stay lasted for a fortnight, during which time I was able to examine the manners and customs of the Aragonese, who were not subject to the ordinances of the Marquis of Aranda, as long cloaks and low hats were to be seen at every corner. They looked like dark phantoms more than men, for the cloak covered up at least half the face. Underneath the cloak was carried el Spadino, a sword of enormous length. Persons who wore this costume were treated with great respect, though they were mostly arrant rogues; still they might possibly be powerful noblemen in disguise. The visitor to Saragossa should see the devotion which is paid to our Lady del Pilar. I have seen processions going along the streets in which wooden statues of gigantic proportions were carried. I was taken to the best assemblies, where the monks swarmed. I was introduced to a lady of monstrous size, who, I was informed, was cousin to the famous Palafox, and I did not feel my bosom swell with pride as was evidently expected.',\n",
       " 'I also made the acquaintance of Canon Pignatelli, a man of Italian origin. He was President of the Inquisition, and every morning he imprisoned the procuress who had furnished him with the girl with whom he had supped and slept. He would wake up in the morning tired out with the pleasures of the night; the girl would be driven away and the procuress imprisoned. He then dressed, confessed, said mass, and after an excellent breakfast with plenty of good wine he would send out for another girl, and this would go on day after day. Nevertheless, he was held in great respect at Saragossa, for he was a monk, a canon, and an Inquisitor. The bull fights were finer at Saragossa than at Madrid—that is to say, they were deadlier; and the chief interest of this barbarous spectacle lies in the shedding of blood. The Marquis de las Moras and Colonel Royas gave me some excellent dinners. The marquis was one of the pleasantest men I met in Spain; he died very young two years after.',\n",
       " 'The Church of Nuestra Senora del Pilar is situated on the ramparts of the town, and the Aragonese fondly believe this portion of the town defences to be impregnable. I had promised Donna Pelliccia to go and see her at Valentia, and on my way I saw the ancient town of Saguntum on a hill at some little distance. There was a priest travelling with me and I told him and the driver (who preferred his mules to all the antiquities in the world) that I should like to go and see the town. How the muleteer and the priest objected to this proposal! \"There are only ruins there, senor. \" The crown settled everything, and the man exclaimed, \"Valga me Dios, es un hombre de buen!\" (So help me God, this is an honest man!) A subject of his Catholic majesty knows no heartier praise than this. I saw the massive walls still standing and in good condition, and yet they were built during the second Punic War.',\n",
       " 'I saw on two of the gateways inscriptions which to me were meaningless, but which Seguier, the old friend of the Marquis Maffei, could no doubt have deciphered. The sight of this monument to the courage of an ancient race, who preferred to perish in the flames rather than surrender, excited my awe and admiration. The priest laughed at me, and I am sure he would not have purchased this venerable city of the dead if he could have done so by saying a mass. The very name has perished; instead of Saguntum it is called Murviedro from the Latin \\'muri veteres\\' (old walls); but Time that destroys marble and brass destroys also the very memory of what has been. \"This place,\" said the priest, \"is always called Murviedro. \" \"It is ridiculous to do so,\" I replied; \"common sense forbids us calling a thing old which was once young enough. That\\'s as if you would tell me that New Castille is really new. \" \"Well, Old Castille is more ancient than New Castille.',\n",
       " 'New Castille was only called so because it was the latest conquest; but as a matter of fact it is the older of the two. \" The poor priest took refuge in silence; shaking his head, and evidently taking me for a madman. I tried vainly to find Hannibal\\'s head, and the inscription in honour of Caesar Claudius, but I found out the remains of the amphitheatre. The next day I remarked the mosaic pavement, which had been discovered twenty years before. I reached Valentia at nine o\\'clock in the morning, and found that I should have to content myself with a bad lodging, as Marescalchi, the opera manager, had taken all the best rooms for the members of his company. Marescalchi was accompanied by his brother, a priest, whom I found decidedly learned for his age. We took a walk together, and he laughed when I proposed going into a cafe, for there was not such a thing in the town. There were only taverns of the lowest class where the wine is not fit to drink.',\n",
       " 'I could scarcely believe it, but Spain is a peculiar country. When I was at Valentia, a good bottle of wine was scarcely obtainable, though Malaga and Alicante were both close at hand. In the first three days of my stay at Valentia (the birthplace of Alexander VI. ), I saw all the objects of interest in the town, and was confirmed in my idea that what seems so admirable in the descriptions of writers and the pictures of artists loses much of its charm on actual inspection. Though Valentia is blessed with an excellent climate, though it is well watered, situated in the midst of a beautiful country, fertile in all the choicest products of nature, though it is the residence of many of the most distinguished of the Spanish nobility, though its women are the most handsome in Spain, though it has the advantage of being the seat of an archbishop; in spite of all these commodities, it is a most disagreeable town to live in.',\n",
       " \"One is ill lodged and ill fed, there is no good wine and no good company, there is not even any intellectual provision, for though there is a university, lettered men are absolutely unknown. As for the bridges, churches, the arsenal, the exchange, the town hall, the twelve town gates, and the rest, I could not take pleasure in a town where the streets are not paved, and where a public promenade is conspicuous by its absence. Outside the town the country is delightful, especially on the side towards the sea; but the outside is not the inside. The feature which pleased me most was the number of small one–horse vehicles which transport the traveller rapidly from one point to another, at a very slight expense, and will even undertake a two or three days' journey. If my frame of mind had been a more pleasant one, I should have travelled through the kingdoms of Murcia and Grenada, which surpass Italy in beauty and fertility.\",\n",
       " 'Poor Spaniards! This beauty and fertility of your land are the cause of your ignorance, as the mines of Peru and Potosi have brought about that foolish pride and all the prejudices which degrade you. Spaniards, when will the impulse come? when will you shake off that fatal lethargy? Now you are truly useless to yourselves, and the rest of the world; what is it you need? A furious revolution, a terrible shock, a conquest of regeneration; your case is past gentle methods, it needs the cautery and the fire. This was not a matter of any difficulty, as the same operas were to be presented as had been already played at Aranjuez, the Escurial, and the Granja, for the Count of Aranda would never have dared to sanction the performance of an Italian comic opera at Madrid. The novelty would have been too great, and the Inquisition would have interfered. The balls were a considerable shock, and two years after they were suppressed.',\n",
       " 'Spain will never make any real advance, until the Inquisition is suppressed also. As soon as Donna Pelliccia arrived, she sent in the letter of introduction she had received from the Duke of Arcos, three months before. She had not seen the duke since their meeting at Aranjuez. \"Madam,\" said Don Diego, the person to whom she was commended, \"I have come to offer you my services, and to tell you of the orders his grace has laid on me, of which you may possibly be ignorant. \" \"I hope, sir,\" she replied, \"that I am not putting you to any inconvenience, but I am extremely grateful to the duke and to yourself; and I shall have the honour of calling on you to give you my thanks. \" \"Not at all; I have only to say that I have orders to furnish you with any sums you may require, to the amount of twenty–five thousand doubloons. \" \"Twenty–five thousand doubloons?\" \"Exactly, madam, two hundred and fifty thousand francs in French money, and no more.',\n",
       " 'Kindly read his grace\\'s letter; you do not seem to be aware of its contents. \" The letter was a brief one: \"Don Diego,—You will furnish Donna Pelliccia with whatever sums she may require, not exceeding twenty–five thousand doubloons, at my account. \"THE DUKE DOS ARCOS\" We remained in a state of perfect stupefaction. Donna Pelliccia returned the epistle to the banker, who bowed and took his leave. This sounds almost incredible generosity, but in Spain such things are not uncommon. I have already mentioned the munificent gift of Medina– Celi to Madame Pichona. Those who are unacquainted with the peculiar Spanish character and the vast riches of some of the nobility, may pronounce such acts of generosity to be ridiculous and positively injurious, but they make a mistake. The spendthrift gives and squanders by a kind of instinct, and so he will continue to do as long as his means remain. But these splendid gifts I have described do not come under the category of senseless prodigality.',\n",
       " 'The Spaniard is chiefly ambitious of praise, for praise he will do anything; but this very desire for admiration serves to restrain him from actions by which he would incur blame. He wants to be thought superior to his fellows, as the Spanish nation is superior to all other nations; he wants to be thought worthy of a throne, and to be considered as the possessor of all the virtues. I may also note that while some of the Spanish nobility are as rich as the English lords, the former have not so many ways of spending their money as the latter, and thus are enabled to be heroically generous on occasion. As soon as Don Diego had gone, we began to discuss the duke\\'s noble behaviour. Donna Pelliccia maintained that the duke had wished to shew his confidence in her by doing her the honour of supposing her incapable of abusing his generosity; \"at all events,\" she concluded, \"I would rather die of hunger than take a single doubloon of Don Diego.',\n",
       " '\" \"The duke would be offended,\" said a violinist; \"I think you ought to take something. I was of the lady\\'s opinion, and told her that I was sure the duke would reward her delicacy by making her fortune. She followed my advice and her own impulse, though the banker remonstrated with her. Such is the perversity of the human mind that no one believed in Donna Pelliccia\\'s delicacy. When the king heard what had happened he ordered the worthy actress to leave Madrid, to prevent the duke ruining himself. Such is often the reward of virtue here below, but the malicious persons who had tried to injure Donna Pelliccia by calumniating her to the king were the means of making her fortune. The duke who had only spoken once or twice to the actress in public, and had never spent a penny on her, took the king\\'s command as an insult, and one not to be borne. He was too proud to solicit the king to revoke the order he had given, and in the end behaved in a way befitting so noble–minded a man.',\n",
       " 'For the first time he visited Donna Pelliccia at her own house, and begging her to forgive him for having been the innocent cause of her disgrace, asked her to accept a rouleau and a letter which he laid on the table. The rouleau contained a hundred gold ounces with the words \"for travelling expenses,\" and the letter was addressed to a Roman bank, and proved to be an order for twenty–four thousand Roman crowns. For twenty–nine years this worthy woman kept an establishment at Rome, and did so in a manner which proved her worthy of her good fortune. The day after Donna Pelliccia\\'s departure the king saw the Duke of Arcos, and told him not to be sad, but to forget the woman, who had been sent away for his own good. \"By sending her away, your majesty obliged me to turn fiction into fact, for I only knew her by speaking to her in various public places, and I had never made her the smallest present.',\n",
       " '\" \"Then you never gave her twenty–five thousand doubloons?\" \"Sire, I gave her double that sum, but only on the day before yesterday. Your majesty has absolute power, but if she had not received her dismissal I should never have gone to her house, nor should I have given her the smallest present. \" The king was stupefied and silent; he was probably meditating on the amount of credit a monarch should give to the gossip that his courtiers bring him. Monnino, who was afterwards known under the title of Castille de Florida Blanca, and is now living in exile in Murcia, his native country. After Marescalchi had gone, and I was making my preparations for my journey to Barcelona, I saw one day, at the bull fight, a woman whose appearance had a strange kind of fascination about it. There was a knight of Alcantara at my side, and I asked him who the lady was. \" \"How famous?\" \"If you do not know her story, it is too long to be told here.',\n",
       " '\" I could not help gazing at her, and two minutes later an ill–looking fellow beside her came up to my companion and whispered something in his ear. The knight turned towards me and informed me in the most polite manner that the lady whose name I had asked desired to know mine. I was silly enough to be flattered by her curiosity, and told the messenger that if the lady would allow me I would come to her box and tell her my name in person after the performance. \"From your accent I should suppose you were an Italian. \" When he had gone away my neighbour seemed inclined to be more communicative, and informed me that Nina was a dancer whom the Count de Ricla, the Viceroy of Barcelona, was keeping for some weeks at Valentia, till he could get her back to Barcelona, whence the bishop of the diocese had expelled her on account of the scandals to which she gave rise. \"The count,\" he added, \"is madly in love with her, and allows her fifty doubloons a day.',\n",
       " '\" \"She can\\'t do that, but she does not let a day pass without committing some expensive act of folly. \" I felt curious to know a woman of such a peculiar character, and longed for the end of the bull fight, little thinking in what trouble this new acquaintance would involve me. She received me with great politeness, and as she got into her carriage drawn by six mules, she said she would be delighted if I would breakfast with her at nine o\\'clock on the following day. Her house was just outside the town walls, and was a very large building. It was richly and tastefully furnished, and was surrounded by an enormous garden. The first thing that struck me was the number of the lackeys and the richness of their liveries, and the maids in elegant attire, who seemed to be going and coming in all directions. As I advanced I heard an imperious voice scolding some one. The scold was Nina, who was abusing an astonished–looking man, who was standing by a large table covered with stuffs and laces.',\n",
       " '\"Excuse me,\" said she, \"but this fool of a Spaniard wants to persuade me that this lace is really handsome. \" She asked me what I thought of the lace, and though I privately thought it lace of the finest quality, I did not care to contradict her, and so replied that I was no judge. \"Madam,\" said the tradesman, \"if you do not like the lace, leave it; will you keep the stuffs?\" \"Yes,\" she replied; \"and as for the lace, I will shew you that it is not the money that deters me. \" So saying the mad girl took up a pair of scissors and cut the lace into fragments. \"What a pity!\" said the man who had spoken to me at the bull fight. \" \"Be silent, you pimping rogue!\" said she, enforcing her words with a sturdy box on the ear. The fellow went off, calling her strumpet, which only made her scream with laughter; then, turning to the Spaniard, she told him to make out his account directly.',\n",
       " 'The man did not want telling twice, and avenged himself for the abuse he had received by the inordinate length of his bill. She took up the account and placed her initials at the bottom without deigning to look at the items, and said,— \"Go to Don Diego Valencia; he will pay you immediately. \" As soon as we were alone the chocolate was served, and she sent a message to the fellow whose ears she had boxed to come to breakfast directly. \"You needn\\'t be surprised at my way of treating him,\" she said. \"He\\'s a rascal whom Ricla has placed in my house to spy out my actions, and I treat him as you have seen, so that he may have plenty of news to write to his master. \" I thought I must be dreaming; such a woman seemed to me beyond the limits of the possible. The poor wretch, who came from Bologna and was a musician by profession, came and sat down with us without a word.',\n",
       " 'As soon as he had finished his breakfast he left the room, and Nina spent an hour with me talking about Spain, Italy, and Portugal, where she had married a dancer named Bergonzi. \"My father,\" she said, \"was the famous charlatan Pelandi; you may have known him at Venice. \" After this piece of confidence (and she did not seem at all ashamed of her parentage) she asked me to sup with her, supper being her favourite meal. I promised to come, and I left her to reflect on the extraordinary character of the woman, and on the good fortune which she so abused. Nina was wonderfully beautiful; but as it has always been my opinion that mere beauty does not go for much, I could not understand how a viceroy could have fallen in love with her to such an extent. As for Molinari, after which I had seen, I could only set him down as an infamous wretch. I went to supper with her for amusement\\'s sake, for, with all her beauty, she had not touched my heart in the slightest degree.',\n",
       " 'It was at the beginning of October, but at Valentia the thermometer marked twenty degrees Reaumur in the shade. Nina was walking in the garden with her companion, both of them being very lightly clad; indeed, Nina had only her chemise and a light petticoat. As soon as she saw me she came up and begged me to follow their example in the way of attire, but I begged to be excused. The presence of that hateful fellow revolted me in the highest degree. In the interval before supper Nina entertained me with a number of lascivious anecdotes of her experiences from the time she began her present mode of living up to the age of twenty–two, which was her age then. If it had not been for the presence of the disgusting Argus, no doubt all these stories would have produced their natural effect on me; but as it was they had none whatever. We had a delicate supper and ate with appetite, and after it was over I would have gladly left them; but Nina would not let me go.',\n",
       " \"The wine had taken effect, and she wished to have a little amusement. After all the servants had been dismissed, this Messalina ordered Molinari to strip naked, and she then began to treat him in a manner which I cannot describe without disgust. The rascal was young and strong, and, though he was drunk, Nina's treatment soon placed him in a hearty condition. I could see that she wished me to play my part in the revels, but my disgust had utterly deprived me of all my amorous faculties. Nina, too, had undressed, and seeing that I viewed the orgy coldly she proceeded to satiate her desires by means of Molinari. I had to bear with the sight of this beautiful woman coupling herself with an animal, whose only merit lay in his virile monstrosity, which she no doubt regarded as a beauty. When she had exhausted her amorous fury she threw herself into a bath, then came back, drank a bottle of Malmsey Madeira, and finally made her brutal lover drink till he fell on to the floor.\",\n",
       " 'I fled into the next room, not being able to bear it any longer, but she followed me. She was still naked, and seating herself beside me on an ottoman she asked me how I had enjoyed the spectacle. I told her boldy that the disgust with which her wretched companion had inspired me was so great that it had utterly annulled the effect of her charms. \"That may be so, but now he is not here, and yet you do nothing. \" \"You are right, for I have my feelings like any other man, but he has disgusted me too much. Wait till tomorrow, and let me not see that monster so unworthy of enjoying you. If I thought he did I would rather die than let him have to do with me, for I detest him. \" \"What! you do not love him, and yet you make use of him in the way you do?\" \"Yes, just as I might use a mechanical instrument. \" In this woman I saw an instance of the depths of degradation to which human nature may be brought.',\n",
       " 'She asked me to sup with her on the following day, telling me that we would be alone, as Molinari would be ill. \" \"You will not go for a week, and then we will go together. \" I went home with my mind made up to depart without having anything more to do with her; and though I was far from inexperienced in wickedness of all kinds, I could not help feeling astonished at the unblushing frankness of this Megaera, who had told me what I already knew, but in words that I had never heard a woman use before. \"I only use him to satisfy my desires, and because I am certain that he does not love me; if I thought he did I would rather die than allow him to do anything with me, for I detest him. \" The next day I went to her at seven o\\'clock in the evening. She received me with an air of feigned melancholy, saying,— \"Alas! we shall have to sup alone; Molinari has got the colic. \" \"You said he would be ill; have you poisoned him?\" \"I am quite capable of doing so, but I hope I never shall.',\n",
       " '\" \"But you have given him something?\" \"Only what he likes himself; but we will talk of that again. Let us sup and play till to–morrow, and tomorrow evening we will begin again. \" \"No, no, you are not; and your coachman will have no cause for complaint, for he has been paid; here is the receipt. \" These remarks, delivered with an air of amorous despotism, flattered my vanity. I made up my mind to submit gaily, called her wanton, and said I was not worth the pains she was taking over me. \"What astonishes me,\" said I, \"is that with this fine house you do not care to entertain company. \" \"Everybody is afraid to come; they fear Ricla\\'s jealousy, for it is well known that that animal who is now suffering from the colic tells him everything I do. He swears that it is not so, but I know him to be a liar. Indeed, I am very glad he does write to Ricla, and only wish he had something of real importance to write about. \" \"He will tell him that I have supped alone with you.',\n",
       " '\" \"All the better; are you afraid?\" \"No; but I think you ought to tell me if I have anything really to fear. \" \"But I should not like to involve you in a dispute which might be prejudicial to your interests. \" \"Not at all; the more I provoke him, the better he loves me, and I will make him pay dearly when he asks me to make it up. \" \"Then you don\\'t love him?\" \"Yes, to ruin him; but he is so rich that there doesn\\'t seem much hope of my ever doing that. \" Before me I saw a woman as beautiful as Venus and as degraded as Lucifer; a woman most surely born to be the ruin of anyone who had the misfortune to fall in love with her. I had known women of similar character, but never one so dangerous as she. I determined to make some money out of her if I could. She called for cards, and asked me to play with her at a game called primiera. It is a game of chance, but of so complicated a nature that the best player always wins.',\n",
       " 'In a quarter of an hour I found that I was the better player, but she had such luck that at the end of the game I had lost twenty pistoles, which I paid on the spot. She took the money, promising to give me my revenge. We had supper, and then we committed all the wantonness she wished and I was capable of performing, for with me the age of miracles was past. The next day I called to see her earlier in the evening. We played again; and she lost, and went on losing evening after evening, till I had won a matter of two or three hundred doubloons, no unwelcome addition to my somewhat depleted purse. The spy recovered from his colic and supped with us every evening, but his presence no longer interfered with my pleasure since Nina had ceased to prostitute herself to him in my presence. She did the opposite; giving herself to me, and telling him to write to the Comte de Ricla whatever he liked. The count wrote her a letter which she gave me to read.',\n",
       " \"The poor love– sick viceroy informed her that she might safely return to Barcelona, as the bishop had received an order from the Court to regard her as merely au actress, whose stay in his diocese would only be temporary; she would thus be allowed to live there in peace so long as she abstained from giving cause for scandal. She told me that whilst she was at Barcelona I could only see her after ten o'clock at night, when the count always left her. Possibly I should not have stayed at Barcelona at all if Nina had not told me that she would always be ready to lend me as much money as I wanted. She asked me to leave Valentia a day before her, and to await her at Tarragona. I did so, and spent a very pleasant day in that town, which abounds in remains of antiquity. I ordered a choice supper according to her instructions, and took care that she should have a separate bedroom so as to avoid any scandal.\",\n",
       " 'She started in the morning begging me to wait till the evening, and to travel by night so as to reach Barcelona by day–time. She told me to put up at the \"Santa Maria,\" and not to call till I had heard from her. I followed all the directions given me by this curious woman, and found myself comfortably lodged at Barcelona. My landlord was a Swiss who told me in confidence that he had received instructions to treat me well, and that I had only to ask for what I wanted.',\n",
       " \"Chapter II My Imprudence--passano--I Am Imprisoned--my Departure From Barcelona-- Madame Castelbajac at Montpellier--nimes--i Arrive at Aix Although my Swiss landlord seemed an honest and trustworthy kind of man, I could not help thinking that Nina had acted very imprudently in commending me to him. She was the viceroy's mistress; and though the viceroy might be a very agreeable man, he was a Spaniard, and not likely to be easy–going in his love affairs. Nina herself had told me that he was ardent, jealous, and suspicious. But the mischief was done, and there was no help for it. When I got up my landlord brought me a valet de place, for whose character he said he could answer, and he then sent up an excellent dinner. After dinner I summoned my host, and asked him whether Nina had told him to get me a servant. He answered in the affirmative, and added that a carriage was awaiting my commands at the door; it had been taken by the week.\",\n",
       " '\"I am astonished to hear it, for no one but myself can say what I can afford or not. \" \"Paid for! I will not have it!\" \"You can settle that with her, but I shall certainly take no payment. \" I saw dangers ahead, but as I have never cared to cherish forbodings I dismissed the idea. I had a letter of introduction from the Marquis de las Moras to Don Miguel de Cevallos, and another from Colonel Royas to Don Diego de la Secada. I took my letters, and the next day Don Diego came to see me, and took me to the Comte de Peralda. The day after Don Miguel introduced me to the Comte de Ricla, Viceroy of Catalonia, and the lover of Nina. The Comte de Peralada was a young man with a pleasant face but with an ill–proportioned body. He was a great debauchee and lover of bad company, an enemy of religion, morality, and law. He was directly descended from the Comte de Peralada, who served Philip II. so well that this king declared him \"count by the grace of God.',\n",
       " '\" The original patent of nobility was the first thing I saw in his antechamber, where it was framed and glazed so that all visitors might see it in the quarter of an hour they were kept waiting. The count received me with an easy and cordiale manner, which seemed to say that he renounced all the dignities of his rank. He thanked Don Diego for introducing me, and talked a good deal about Colonel Royas. He asked me if I had seen the English girl he was keeping at Saragossa, and on my replying in the affirmative, he told me in a whisper that he had slept with her. He took me to his stables, where he had some splendid horses, and then asked me to dine with him the next day.',\n",
       " \"The viceroy received me in a very different manner; he stood up so that he might not have to offer me a chair, and though I spoke Italian, with which language I knew him to be well acquainted, he answered me in Spanish, styling me 'ussia' (a contraction of 'vuestra senoria', your lordship, and used by everyone in Spain), while I gave him his proper title of excellence. He talked a good deal about Madrid, and complained that M. de Mocenigo had gone to Paris by Bayonne instead of Barcelona, as he had promised him. I tried to excuse my ambassador by saying that by taking the other route he had saved fifty leagues of his journey, but the viceroy replied that 'tenir la palabra' (keeping to one's words) comes before all else. He asked me if I thought of staying long at Barcelona, and seemed surprised when I told him that, with his leave, I hoped to make a long stay.\",\n",
       " '\"I hope you will enjoy yourself,\" he said, \"but I must warn you that if you indulge in the pleasures which my nephew Peralada will doubtless offer you, you will not enjoy a very good reputation at Barcelona. \" As the Comte de Ricla made this observation in public, I thought myself justified in communicating it to Peralada himself. He was delighted, and told me, with evident vanity, that he had gone to Madrid three times, and had been ordered to return to Catalonia on each occasion. I thought my best plan would be to follow the viceroy\\'s indirect advice, so I refused to join in any of the little parties of pleasure which Peralada proposed. On the fifth day after my arrival, an officer came to ask me to dinner at the viceroy\\'s. I accepted the invitation with much pleasure, for I had been afraid of the viceroy\\'s having heard of my relations with Nina, and thought it possible that he might have taken a dislike to me.',\n",
       " \"He was very pleasant to me at dinner, often addressing his observations to me, but always in a tone of great gravity. I had been in Barcelona for a week, and was beginning to wonder why I had not heard from Nina; but one evening she wrote me a note, begging me to come on foot and alone to her house at ten o'clock the same night. If I had been wise I should not have gone, for I was not in love with the woman, and should have remembered the respect due to the viceroy; but I was devoid of all wisdom and prudence. All the misfortunes I have experienced in my long life never taught me those two most necessary virtues. At the hour she had named I called on her, wearing my great coat, and with a sword for my only weapon. I found Nina with her sister, a woman of thirty–six or thereabouts, who was married to an Italian dancer, nicknamed Schizza, because he had a flatter nose than any Tartar.\",\n",
       " 'Nina had just been supping with her lover, who had left her at ten o\\'clock, according to his invariable custom. She said she was delighted to hear I had been to dinner with him, as she had herself spoken to him in my praise, saying how admirably I had kept her company at Valentia. \"I am glad to hear it, but I do not think you are wise in inviting me to your house at such late hours. \" \"I only do so to avoid scandal amongst my neighbours. \" \"In my opinion my coming so late is only likely to increase the probability of scandal, and to make your viceroy jealous. \" I went away at midnight, after a conversation of the most decent character. Her sister did not leave us for a moment, and Nina gave her no cause to suspect the intimacy of our relations. I went to see her every evening, without encroaching on the count\\'s preserves. I thought myself secure, but the following warning should have made me desist if I had not been carried away by the forces of destiny and obstinacy in combination.',\n",
       " 'An officer in the Walloon Guards accosted me one day as I was walking by myself just outside the town. He begged me in the most polite manner to excuse him if he spoke on a matter which was indifferent to him but of great consequence to me. \"Speak, sir,\" I replied, \"I will take whatever you say in good part. You are a stranger, sir, and may not be acquainted with our Spanish manners, consequently you are unaware of the great risk you run in going to see Nina every evening after the count has left her. \" \"What risk do I run? I have no doubt that the count knows all about it and does not object. \" \"I have no doubt as to his knowing it, and he may possibly pretend to know nothing before her, as he fears as well as loves her; but if she tells you that he does not object, she either deceives herself or you. He cannot love her without being jealous, and a jealous Spaniard … \"Follow my advice, sir, and forgive my freedom.',\n",
       " '\" \"I am sincerely obliged to you for your kind interest in me, but I cannot follow your advice, as by doing so I should be wanting in politeness to Nina, who likes to see me and gives me a warm welcome. I shall continue to visit her till she orders me not to do so, or till the count signifies to me his displeasure at my visits to his mistress. \" \"The count will never do such a thing; he is too careful of his dignity. \" The worthy officer then narrated to me all the acts of injustice which Ricla had committed since he had fallen in love with this woman. He had dismissed gentlemen from his service on the mere suspicion that they were in love with her; some had been exiled, and others imprisoned on one frivolous pretext or another. Before he had known Nina he had been a pattern of wisdom, justice, and virtue, and now he had become unjust, cruel, blindly passionate, and in every way a scandal to the high position he occupied.',\n",
       " 'All this should have influenced me, but it had not the slightest effect. I told him for politeness\\' sake that I would endeavour to part from her by degrees, but I had no intention of doing so. When I asked him how he knew that I visited Nina, he laughed and said it was a common topic of conversation all over the town. The same evening I called on her without mentioning my conversation with the officer. There would have been some excuse for me if I had been in love with her, but as it was … I acted like a madman. On the 14th of November I went to see her at the usual time. I found her with a man who was shewing her miniatures. I looked at him and found that he was the scoundrel Passano, or Pogomas. My blood boiled; I took Nina\\'s hand and led her into a neighbouring room, and told her to dismiss the rogue at once, or I would go to return no more. \" \"I am well acquainted with his history, and will tell you all about it presently; but send him away, or I shall go.',\n",
       " '\" She called her sister, and told her to order the Genoese to leave the house and never to enter it again. The thing was \\'done in a moment, but the sister told us that as he went out he had said,— \"Se ne pentira. I occupied an hour in relating some of the injuries I had received from this scoundrelly fellow. The next day (November 15th), I went to Nina at the usual time, and after spending two hours in pleasant converse with her and her sister I went out as the clocks were striking midnight. The door of the house was under an arcade, which extended to the end of the street. It was a dark night; and I had scarcely gone twenty–five paces when two men suddenly rushed at me. I stepped back, drawing my sword, and exclaiming, \"Assassins!\" and then with a rapid movement, I thrust my blade into the body of the nearest assailant. I then left the arcade, and began to run down the street. The second assassin fired a pistol at me, but it fortunately missed me.',\n",
       " 'I fell down and dropped my hat in my rapid flight, and got up and continued my course without troubling to pick it up. I did not know whether I was wounded or not, but at last I got to my inn, and laid down the bloody sword on the counter, under the landlord\\'s nose. I told the landlord what had happened, and on taking off my great coat, I found it to be pierced in two places just below the armpit. \"I am going to bed,\" I said to the landlord, \"and I leave my great coat and the sword in your charge. Tomorrow morning I shall ask you to come with me before the magistrate to denounce this act of assassination, for if the man was killed it must be shewn that I only slew him to save my own life. \" \"I think your best plan would be to fly Barcelona immediately. \" \"Then you think I have not told you the strict truth?\" \"I am sure you have; but I know whence the blow comes, and God knows what will befall you!\" \"Nothing at all; but if I fly I shall be accounted guilty.',\n",
       " 'Take care of the sword; they tried to assassinate me, but I think the assassins got the worst of it. \" I went to bed somewhat perturbed, but I had the consoling thought that if I had killed a man I had done so to self–defence; my conscience was quite clear. At seven o\\'clock the next morning I heard a knocking at my door. I opened it, and saw my landlord, accompanied by an officer, who told me to give him all my papers, to dress, and to follow him, adding that he should be compelled to use force in case of resistance. \"By whose authority do you ask me for my papers?\" \"By the authority of the governor. They will be returned to you if nothing suspicious is found amongst them. \" \"Where are you going to take me?\" \"To the citadel. \" I opened my trunk, took out my linen and my clothes, which I gave to my landlord, and I saw the officer\\'s astonishment at seeing my trunk half filled with papers. \"I advise you, sir,\" he said, \"to put all necessary articles into a portmanteau.',\n",
       " '\" He then ordered the landlord to send me a bed, and finally asked me if I had any papers in my pockets. \" \"That\\'s exactly what we want,\" he rejoined, with a grim smile. \"My passports are sacred; I will never give them to anyone but the governor–general. Reverence your king; here is his passport, here is that of the Count of Aranda, and here the passport of the Venetian ambassador. You will have to bind me hand and foot before you get them. In giving them to me it is just as if you gave them to the viceroy. If you resist I will not bind you hand and foot, but I shall take you before the viceroy, and then you will be forced to give them up in public. Give them to me with a good grace, and you shall have an acknowledgement. \" The worthy landlord told me I should be wiser to give in, so I let myself be persuaded. The officer gave me a full quittance, which I put in my pocketbook (this he let me keep out of his kindness), and then I followed him.',\n",
       " 'He had six constables with him, but they kept a good distance away. Comparing this with the circumstances of my arrest at Madrid, I thought myself well treated. Before we left the inn the officer told me that I might order what meals I pleased, and I asked the landlord to let me have my dinner and supper as usual. On the way I told him of my adventure of the night before; he listened attentively but made no comments. When we reached the citadel I was delivered to the officer of the guard, who gave me a room on the first floor. It was bare of furniture, but the windows looked on to a square and had no iron bars. I had scarcely been there ten minutes when my carpet bag and an excellent bed were brought in. As soon as I was alone I began to think over the situation. \"What can this imprisonment have to do with my last night\\'s adventure?\" I reflected.',\n",
       " '\"They are bent on examining my papers; they must think I have been tampering in some political or religious intrigue; but my mind is quite at ease on that score. I am well lodged at present, and no doubt shall be set free after my papers have been examined; they can find nothing against me there. \"The affair of my attempted assassination will, no doubt, be considered separately. \"Even if the rascal is dead, I do not see what they can do to me. \"On the other hand, my landlord\\'s advice to fly from Barcelona looks ominous; what if the assassins received their orders from some person high in authority? \"It is possible that Ricla may have vowed my ruin, but it does not seem probable to me. \"Would it have been wise to follow the landlord\\'s advice? \"Possibly, but I do not think so; my honour would have suffered, and I might have been caught and laid up in some horrid dungeon, whereas for a prison I am comfortable enough here.',\n",
       " '\"In three or four days the examination of my papers will have been completed, and as there is nothing in them likely to be offensive to the powers that be, they will be returned to me with my liberty, which will taste all the sweeter for this short deprivation. \"I cannot think that the all–powerful hand of the viceroy could have directed the assassin\\'s sword; it would be a dishonour to him, and if it were so, he would not be treating me so kindly now. If it were his doing, he must have heard directly that the blow had failed, and in that case I do not think he would have arrested me this morning. \"Shall I write to Nina? Will writing be allowed here?\" As I was puzzling my brains with these reflections, stretched on my bed (for I had no chair), I heard some disturbance, and on opening my window I saw, to my great astonishment, Passano being brought into the prison by a corporal and two soldiers. As he was going in, the rascal looked up and saw me, and began to laugh.',\n",
       " '\"Alas!\" I said to myself, \"here is fresh food for conjecture. The fellow told Nina\\'s sister that I should be sorry for what I had done. He must have directed some fearful calumny against me, and they are imprisoning him so as to be sure of his evidence. \" On reflection, I was well pleased at the turn affairs had taken. An excellent dinner was set before me, but I had no chair or table. The deficiency was remedied by the soldier who was in charge of me for the consideration of a duro. Prisoners were not allowed to have pen and ink without special permission; but paper and pencils were not included under this regulation, so my guard got them for me, together with candles and candlesticks, and I proceeded to kill time by making geometrical calculations. I made the obliging soldier sup with me, and he promised to commend me to one of his comrades who would serve me well.',\n",
       " 'On the fourth day the officer of the guard came to me with a distressed look, and told me that he had the disagreeable duty of giving me some very bad news. \"What is that, sir?\" \"I have received orders to transfer you to the bottom of the tower. \" \"Then they must have discovered in me a criminal of the deepest dye! Let us go at once. \" I found myself in a kind of round cellar, paved with large flagstones, and lighted by five or six narrow slits in the walls. The officer told me I must order what food required to be brought once a day, as no one was allowed to come into the \\'calabozo\\', or dungeon, by night. \"How about lights?\" \"You may lave one lamp always burning, and that will be enough, as books are not allowed. When your dinner is brought, the officer on duty will open the pies and the poultry to see that they do not contain any documents; for here no letters are allowed to come in or go out. \" \"Have these orders been given for my especial benefit?\" \"No, sir; it is the ordinary rule.',\n",
       " '\" \"How about the cleanliness of my cell?\" \"A soldier will accompany the officer in charge of your dinner, and he will attend to your wants for a trifle. \" \"May I amuse myself by making architectural plans with the pencil?\" \"As much as you like. \" \"Then will you be good enough to order some paper to be bought for me?\" \"With pleasure. \" The officer seemed to pity me as he left me, and bolted and barred the heavy door behind which I saw a man standing sentry with his bayonet fixed. When I got my paper and my dinner at noonday the officer cut open a fowl, and plunged a fork in the other dishes so as to make sure that there were no papers at the bottom. I told the officer that I should be much honoured by his dining with me, but he replied that it was strictly forbidden. He gave me the same answer when I asked if I might have the newspapers.',\n",
       " 'It was a festival time for the sentinels, as I shared my meals and my good wine with them; and consequently these poor fellows were firmly attached to me. I was curious to know who was paying for my good cheer, but there was no chance of my finding out, for the waiter from the inn was never allowed to approach my cell. In this dungeon, where I was imprisoned for forty–two days, I wrote in pencil and without other reference than my memory, my refutation of Amelot de la Houssaye\\'s \"History of the Venetian Government. \" I was most heartily amused during my imprisonment, and in the following manner: While I was at Warsaw an Italian named Tadini came to Warsaw. He had an introduction to Tomatis who commended him to me. Tomatis used to give him a dinner now and again, but not being well off in those days I could only give him good words and a cup of coffee when he chanced to come about my breakfast–time.',\n",
       " 'Tadini talked to everybody about the operations he had performed, and condemned an oculist who had been at Warsaw for twenty years, saying that he did not understand how to extract a cataract, while the other oculist said that Tadini was a charlatan who did not know how the eye was made. Tadini begged me to speak in his favour to a lady who had had a cataract removed by the Warsaw oculist, only to return again a short time after the operation. The lady was blind of the one eye, but she could see with the other, and I told Tadini that I did not care to meddle with such a delicate matter. \"I have spoken to the lady,\" said Tadini, \"and I have mentioned your name as a person who will answer for me. \" \"You have done wrong; in such a matter I would not stand surety for the most learned of men, and I know nothing about your learning. \" \"I know you were introduced to me as such, but that\\'s all.',\n",
       " 'As a professional man, you should not need anyone\\'s commendation, you should be able to say, \\'Operibus credite\\'. \" Tadini was vexed with my incredulity, and shewed me a number of testimonials, which I might possibly have read, if the first which met my eye had not been from a lady who protested to all and singular that M. At this I laughed in his face and told him to leave me alone. A few days after I found myself dining with him at the house of the lady with the cataract. She had almost made up her mind to submit to the operation, but as the rascal had mentioned my name, she wanted me to be present at a dispute between Tadini and the other oculist who came in with the dessert. I disposed myself to listen to the arguments of the two rival professors with considerable pleasure. The Warsaw oculist was a German, but spoke French very well; however, he attacked Tadini in Latin.',\n",
       " 'The Italian checked him by saying that their discourse must be conducted in a language intelligible to the lady, and I agreed with him. It was plain that Tadini did not know a word of Latin. The German oculist began by admitting that after the operation for cataract there was no chance of the disease returning, but that there was a considerable risk of the crystalline humour evaporating, and the patient being left in a state of total blindness. Tadini, instead of denying this statement (which was inaccurate), had the folly to take a little box out of his pocket. \"A substance which I can place in the cornea to supply the loss of the crystalline matter. \" The German went off into a roar of laughter so long and loud that the lady could not help laughing. I should have liked to join them, but I was ashamed to be thought the patron of this ignorant fellow, so I preserved a gloomy silence.',\n",
       " 'Tadini no doubt interpreted my silence as a mark of disapproval of the German\\'s laughter, and thought to better matters by asking me to give my opinion. \" \"There\\'s a great difference between a tooth and the crystalline humour; and though you may have succeeded in putting an artificial tooth into a gum, this treatment will not do with the eye. \" At this the ignorant rascal got up and left the room, and it was decidedly the best thing he could do. We laughed over this new treatment, and the lady promised to have nothing more to do with him. The professor was not content to despise his opponent in silence. He had him cited before the Faculty of Medicine to be examined on his knowledge of the eye, and procured the insertion of a satiric article in the news on the new operation for replacing the crystalline humour, alluding to the wonderful artist then in Warsaw who could perform this operation as easily as a dentist could put in a false tooth.',\n",
       " 'This made Tadini furious, and he set upon the old professor in the street and forced him to the refuge in a house. After this he no doubt left the town on foot, for he was seen no more. Now the reader is in a position to understand my surprise and amusement, when, one day as I peered through the grating in my dungeon, I saw the oculist Tadini standing over me with gun in hand. But he at all events evinced no amusement whatever, while I roared and roared again with laughter for the two hours his duty lasted. I gave him a good meal and a sufficiency of my excellent wine, and at the end a crown, promising that he should have the same treatment every time he returned to the post. But I only saw him four times, as the guard at my cell was a position eagerly coveted and intrigued for by the other soldiers. He amused me by the story of his misadventures since he had left Warsaw.',\n",
       " 'He had travelled far and wide without making a fortune, and at last arrived in Barcelona, where he failed to meet with any courtesy or consideration. He had no introduction, no diploma; he had refused to submit to an examination in the Latin tongue, because (as he said) there was no connection between the learned languages and the diseases of the eye; and the result was that, instead of the common fate of being ordered to leave the country, he was made into a soldier. He told me in confidence that he intended to desert, but he said he should take care to avoid the galleys. \"What have you done with your crystals?\" \"I have renounced them since I left Warsaw, though I am sure they would succeed. On December 28th, six weeks after my arrest, the officer of the guard came to my cell and told me to dress and follow him. \"Where are we going?\" \"I am about to deliver you to an officer of the viceroy, who is waiting.',\n",
       " '\" I dressed hastily, and after placing all my belongings in a portmanteau I followed him. We went to the guardroom, and there I was placed under the charge of the officer who had arrested me, who took me to the palace. There a Government official shewed me my trunk, telling me that I should find all my papers intact; and he then returned me my three passports, with the remark that they were genuine documents. \" \"I suppose so, but we had reasons for doubting their authenticity. \" \"They must have been strange reasons, for, as you now confess, these reasons were devoid of reason. \" \"You must be aware that I cannot reply to such an objection. \" \"Your character is perfectly clear; all the same I must request you to leave Barcelona in three days, and Catalonia in a week. \" \"Of course I will obey; but it strikes me that the Catalonian method of repairing injustice is somewhat peculiar. \" \"If you think you have ground for complaint you are at liberty to go to Madrid and complain to the Court.',\n",
       " '\" \"I have certainly grounds enough for complaint, sir, but I shall go to France, and not to Madrid; I have had enough of Spanish justice. Will you please give me the order to leave in writing?\" \"That\\'s unnecessary; you may take it for granted. My name is Emmanuel Badillo; I am a secretary of state. That gentleman will escort you back to the room where you were arrested. To–morrow I will send you your passport, signed by the viceroy and myself. \" Accompanied by the officer and a servant bearing my portmanteau, I proceeded to my old inn. On my way I saw a theatrical poster, and decided to go to the opera. The good landlord was delighted to see me again, and hastened to light me a fire, for a bitterly cold north wind was blowing. He assured me that no one but himself had been in my room, and in the officer\\'s presence he gave me back my sword, my great coat, and, to my astonishment, the hat I had dropped in my flight from the assassins.',\n",
       " 'The officer asked me if I had any complaints to make, and I replied that I had none. \"I should like to hear you say that I had done nothing but my duty, and that personally I have not done you any injury. \"Farewell, sir,\" said he, \"I hope you will have a pleasant journey. \" I told my landlord that I would dine at noon, and that I trusted to him to celebrate my liberation in a fitting manner, and then I went to the post office to see if there were any letters for me. I found five or six letters, with the seals intact, much to my astonishment. What is one to make of a Government which deprives a man of his liberty on some trifling pretext, and, though seizing all his papers, respects the privacy of his letters? But Spain, as I have remarked, is peculiar in every way. These letters were from Paris, Venice, Warsaw, and Madrid, and I have never had any reason to believe that any other letters had come for me during my imprisonment.',\n",
       " 'I went back to my inn, and asked my landlord to bring the bill. Here is your bill for the period preceding your imprisonment, and, as you see, it has been settled. I also received orders from the same source to provide for you during your imprisonment, and as long as you stayed at Barcelona. \" \"Did you know how long I should remain in prison?\" \"No, I was paid by the week. \" \"What has become of the valet de place?\" \"I paid him, and sent him away immediately after your arrest. \" \"I should like to have him with me as far as Perpignan. \" \"You are right, and I think the best thing you can do is to leave Spain altogether, for you will find no justice in it. \" \"What do they say about my assassination?\" \"Why, they say you fired the shot that people heard yourself, and that you made your own sword bloody, for no one was found there, either dead or wounded. Where did my hat come from?\" \"It was brought to me three days after.',\n",
       " '\" \"What a confusion! But was it known that I was imprisoned in the tower?\" \"Everybody knew it, and two good reasons were given, the one in public, and the other in private. \" \"What are these reasons?\" \"The public reason was that you had forged your passports; the private one, which was only whispered at the ear, was that you spent all your nights with Nina. \" \"You might have sworn that I never slept out of your inn. \" \"I told everyone as much, but no matter; you did go to her house, and for a certain nobleman that\\'s a crime. I am glad you did not fly as I advised you, for as it is your character is cleared before everybody. \" \"I should like to go to the opera this evening; take me a box. \" \"It shall be done; but do not have anything more to do with Nina, I entreat you. \" \"No, my good friend, I have made up my mind to see her no more. \" Just as I was sitting down to dinner, a banker\\'s clerk brought me a letter which pleased me very much.',\n",
       " 'It contained the bills of exchange I had drawn in Genoa, in favour of M. He now sent them back, with these words: \"Passano has been vainly endeavouring to persuade me to send these bills to Barcelona, so that they may be protested, and you arrested. I now send them to you to convince you that I am not one of those who delight in trampling down the victims of bad fortune. \" For the fourth time a Genoese had behaved most generously to me. I was almost persuaded that I ought to forgive the infamous Passano for the sake of his four excellent fellow–countrymen. I concluded that the best thing I could do would be to rid the Genoese name of the opprobrium which this rascal was always bringing on it, but I could never find an opportunity. Some years after I heard that the wretch died in miserable poverty in Genoa. I was curious at the time to know what had become of him, as it was important for me to be on my guard.',\n",
       " \"I confided my curiosity to my landlord, and he instructed one of the servants to make enquiries. I only heard the following circumstance: Ascanio Pogomas, or Passano, had been released at the end of November, and had then been embarked on a felucca bound for Toulon. The same day I wrote a long and grateful letter to M. I had indeed reason to be grateful, for if he had listened to my enemy he might have reduced me to a state of dreadful misery. My landlord had taken the box at the opera in my name, and two hours afterwards, to everyone's great astonishment, the posters announcing the plays of the evening were covered by bills informing the public that two of the performers had been taken ill, that the play would not be given, and the theatre closed till the second day of the new year. This order undoubtedly came from the viceroy, and everybody knew the reason.\",\n",
       " \"I was sorry to have deprived the people of Barcelona of the only amusement they had in the evening, and resolved to stay indoors, thinking that would be the most dignified course I could adopt. Petrarch says,— 'Amor che fa gentile un cor villano'. If he had known the lover of Nina he would have changed the line into 'Amor che fa villan un cor gentile'. In four months I shall be able to throw some more light on this strange business. I should have left Barcelona the same day, but a slight tinge of superstition made me desire to leave on the last day of the unhappy year I had spent in Spain. I therefore spent my three days of grace in writing letters to all my friends. Don Miguel de Cevallos, Don Diego de la Secada, and the Comte de la Peralada came to see me, but separately. Don Diego de la Secada was the uncle of the Countess A― B― whom I had met at Milan. These gentlemen told me a tale as strange as any of the circumstances which had happened to me at Barcelona.\",\n",
       " \"On the 26th of December the Abbe Marquisio, the envoy of the Duke of Modena, asked the viceroy, before a considerable number of people, if he could pay me a visit, to give me a letter which he could place in no hands but mine. If not he said he should be obliged to take the letter to Madrid, for which town he was obliged to set out the next day. The count made no answer, to everyone's astonishment, and the abbe left for Madrid the next day, the eve of my being set at liberty. I wrote to the abbe, who was unknown to me, but I never succeeded in finding out the truth about this letter. There could be no doubt that I had been arrested by the despotic viceroy, who had been persuaded by Nina that I was her favoured lover. The question of my passports must have been a mere pretext, for eight or ten days would have sufficed to send them to Madrid and have them back again if their authenticity had been doubted.\",\n",
       " 'Possibly Passano might have told the viceroy that any passports of mine were bound to be false, as I should have had to obtain the signature of my own ambassador. This, he might have said, was out of the question as I was in disgrace with the Venetian Government. As a matter of fact, he was mistaken if he really said so, but the mistake would have been an excusable one. When I made up my mind at the end of August to leave Madrid, I asked the Count of Aranda for a passport. He replied that I must first obtain one from my ambassador, who, he added, could not refuse to do me this service. Fortified with this opinion I called at the embassy. Querini was at San Ildefonso at the time, and I told the porter that I wanted to speak to the secretary of embassy. The servant sent in my name, and the fop gave himself airs, and pretended that he could not receive me.',\n",
       " 'In my indignation I wrote to him saying that I had not called to pay my court to the secretary, but to demand a passport which was my right. I gave my name and my degree (doctor of law), and begged him to leave the passport with the porter, as I should call for it on the following day. I presented myself accordingly, and the porter told me that the ambassador had left verbal orders that I was not to have a passport. I wrote immediately to the Marquis Grimaldi and to the Duke of Lossada, begging them to request the ambassador to send me a passport in the usual form, or else I should publish the shameful reasons for which his uncle Mocenigo had disgraced me. I do not know whether these gentlemen shewed my letters to Querini, but I do know that the secretary Oliviera sent me my passport. Thereupon the Count Aranda furnished me with a passport signed by the king.',\n",
       " 'On the last day of the year I left Barcelona with a servant who sat behind my chaise, and I agreed with my driver to take me to Perpignan by January 3rd, 1769. The driver was a Piedmontese and a worthy man: The next day he came into the room of the wayside inn where I was dining, and in the presence of my man asked me whether I had any suspicion that I was being followed. \"Well, I may be,\" I said, \"but what makes you ask that question?\" \"As you were leaving Barcelona yesterday, I noticed three ill–looking fellows watching us, armed to the teeth. They dined here to–day, and they went on three quarters of an hour ago. They don\\'t speak to anyone, and I don\\'t like the looks of them. \" \"What shall we do to avoid assassination, or the dread of it?\" \"We must start late, and stop at an inn I know of, a league this side of the ordinary stage where they will be awaiting us. If they turn back, and sleep at the same inn as ourselves, we shall be certain.',\n",
       " '\" I thought the idea a sensible one, and we started, I going on foot nearly the whole way; and at five o\\'clock we halted at a wretched inn, but we saw no signs of the sinister trio. At eight o\\'clock I was at supper, when my man came in and told me that the three fellows had come back, and were drinking with our driver in the stable. At present, it was true, I had nothing to fear; but it would be getting dark when we arrived at the frontier, and then my peril would come. I told my servant to shew no sign, but to ask the driver to come and speak with me when the assassins were asleep. He came at ten o\\'clock, and told me plainly that we should be all murdered as we approached the French frontier. \"Then you have been drinking with them?\" \"Yes, and after we had dispatched a bottle at my expense, one of them asked me why I had not gone on to the end of the stage, where you would be better lodged.',\n",
       " 'I might have asked in my turn, why they had not stayed at the stage themselves, and where they were going, but I took care to do nothing of the kind. All I asked was whether the road to Perpignan was a good one, and they told me it was excellent all the way. \" \"What are they doing now?\" \"They are sleeping by my mules, covered with their cloaks. \" \"What shall we do?\" \"We will start at day–break after them, of course, and we shall dine at the usual stage; but after dinner, trust me, we will take a different road, and at midnight we shall be in France safe and sound. \" If I could have procured a good armed escort I would not have taken his advice, but in the situation I was in I had no choice. We found the three scoundrels in the place where the driver had told me we should see them. I gave them a searching glance, and thought they looked like true Sicarii, ready to kill anyone for a little money.',\n",
       " \"They started in a quarter of an hour, and half an hour later we set out, with a peasant to guide us, and so struck into a cross road. The mules went at a sharp pace, and in seven hours we had done eleven leagues. At ten o'clock we stopped at an inn in a French village, and we had no more to fear. I gave our guide a doubloon, with which he was well pleased, and I enjoyed once more a peaceful night in a French bed, for nowhere will you find such soft beds or such delicious wines as in the good land of France. The next day I arrived at the posting–inn at Perpignan in time for dinner. I endeavoured in vain to think who could have paid my assassins, but the reader will see the explanation when we get twenty days farther. At Perpignan I dismissed my driver and my servant, rewarding them according to my ability. I wrote to my brother at Paris, telling him I had had a fortunate escape from the dagger of the assassin.\",\n",
       " 'I begged him to direct his answer to Aix, where I intended to spend a fortnight, in the hope of seeing the Marquis d\\'Argens. I left Perpignan the day after my arrival, and slept at Narbonne, and the day after at Beziers. The distance from Narbonne to Beziers is only five leagues, and I had not intended to stop; but the good cheer which the kindest of landladies gave me at dinner made me stop with her to supper. Beziers is a town which looks pleasant even at the worst time of the year. A philosopher who wished to renounce all the vanities of the world, and an Epicurean who would enjoy good cheer cheaply, could find no better retreat than Beziers. Everybody at Beziers is intelligent, all the women are pretty, and the cooks are all artists; the wines are exquisite—what more could one desire! May its riches never prove its ruin! When I reached Montpellier, I got down at the \"White Horse,\" with the intention of spending a week there.',\n",
       " \"In the evening I supped at the table d'hote, where I found a numerous company, and I saw to my amusement that for every guest there was a separate dish brought to table. 'Tis a veritable land of Cocagne! The next day I breakfasted at the cafe (an institution peculiar to France, the only country where the science of living is really understood), and addressed the first gentleman I met, telling him that I was a stranger and that I would like to know some of the professors. He immediately offered to take me to one of the professors who enjoyed a great reputation. Herein may be seen another of the good qualities of the French, who rank above other nations by so many titles. To a Frenchman a foreigner is a sacred being; he receives the best of hospitality, not merely in form, but in deed; and his welcome is given with that easy grace which so soon sets a stranger at his ease.\",\n",
       " 'My new friend introduced me to the professor, who received me with all the polished courtesy of the French man of letters. He that loves letters should love all other lovers of letters, and in France that is the case, even more so than Italy. In Germany the literary man has an air of mysterious reserve. He thinks he is proclaiming to all the world that he at all events is a man of no pretension, whereas his pride peeps through every moment. Naturally the stranger is not encouraged by such a manner as this. At the time of my visit there was an excellent company of actors at Montpellier, whom I went to see the same evening. My bosom swelled at finding myself in the blessed air of France after all the annoyances I had gone through in Spain. I seemed to have become young again; but I was altered, for several beautiful and clever actresses appeared on the stage without arousing any desires within me; and I would have it so.',\n",
       " \"I had a lively desire to find Madame Castelbajac, not with any wish to renew my old relations with her. I wished to congratulate her on her improved position, but I was afraid of compromising her by asking for her in the town. I knew that her husband was an apothecary, so I resolved to make the acquaintance of all the apothecaries in the place. I pretended to be in want of some very rare drugs, and entered into conversation about the differences between the trade in France and in foreign countries. If I spoke to the master I hoped he would talk to his wife about the stranger who had visited the countries where she had been, and that that would make her curious to know me. If, on the other hand, I spoke to the man, I knew he would soon tell me all he knew about his master's family. My old friend wrote me a note, telling me that she had seen me speaking to her husband in his shop.\",\n",
       " 'She begged me to come again at a certain time, and to tell her husband that I had known her under the name of Mdlle. Blasin in England, Spa, Leipzig, and Vienna, as a seller of lace. She ended her note with these words: \"I have no doubt that my husband will finally introduce you to me as his wife. \" I followed her advice, and the good man asked me if I had ever known a young lace seller of the name of Mdlle. \"Yes, I remember her well enough—a delightful and most respectable young woman; but I did not know she came from Montpellier. She was very pretty and very sensible, and I expect she did a good business. I have seen her in several European cities, and the last time at Vienna, where I was able to be of some slight service to her. Her admirable behaviour won her the esteem of all the ladies with whom she came in contact.',\n",
       " '\" \"Do you think you would recognize her if you saw her again?\" \"By Jove! I should think so! But is she at Montpellier? If so, tell her that the Chevalier de Seingalt is here. \" \"Sir, you shall speak to her yourself, if you will do me the honour to follow me. The worthy apothecary went through the shop, climbed a stair, and, opening a door on the first floor, said to me,— \"There she is. \" \"What, mademoiselle! You here? I am delighted to see you. \" \"This is not a young lady, sir, \\'tis my dear wife; but I hope that will not hinder you from embracing her. \" \"I have never had such an honour; but I will avail myself of your permission with pleasure. I congratulate both of you, and wish you all health and happiness. Tell me, did you have a pleasant journey from Vienna to Lyons?\" Madame Blasin (for so I must continue to designate her) answered my question according to her fancy, and found me as good an actor as she was an actress.',\n",
       " 'We were very glad to see each other again, but the apothecary was delighted at the great respect with which I treated his wife. For a whole hour we carried on a conversation of a perfectly imaginary character, and with all the simplicity of perfect truth. She asked me if I thought of spending the carnival at Montpellier, and seemed quite mortified when I said that I thought of going on the next day. Her husband hastened to say that that was quite out of the question. \"Oh, I hope you won\\'t go,\" she added, \"you must do my husband the honour of dining with us. \" After the husband had pressed me for some time I gave in, and accepted their invitation to dinner for the day after next. I was much pleased with the husband\\'s mother, who was advanced in years but extremely intelligent. She had evidently made a point of forgetting everything unpleasant in the past history of her son\\'s wife.',\n",
       " 'Madame Blasin told me in private that she was perfectly happy, and I had every reason to believe that she was speaking the truth. She had made a rule to be most precise in fulfilling her wifely duties, and rarely went out unless accompanied by her husband or her mother–in–law. I spent these four days in the enjoyment of pure and innocent friendship without there being the slightest desire on either side to renew our guilty pleasures. On the third day after I had dined with her and her husband, she told me, while we were alone for a moment, that if I wanted fifty louis she knew where to get them for me. I told her to keep them for another time, if I was so happy as to see her again, and so unhappy as to be in want. I left Montpellier feeling certain that my visit had increased the esteem in which her husband and her mother–in–law held her, and I congratulated myself on my ability to be happy without committing any sins.',\n",
       " 'The day after I had bade them farewell, I slept at Nimes, where I spent three days in the company of a naturalist: M. de Seguier, the friend of the Marquis Maffei of Verona. In his cabinet of natural history I saw and admired the immensity and infinity of the Creator\\'s handiwork. Nimes is a town well worthy of the stranger\\'s observation; it provides food for the mind, and the fair sex, which is really fair there, should give the heart the food it likes best. I was asked to a ball, where, as a foreigner, I took first place—a privilege peculiar to France, for in England, and still more in Spain, a foreigner means an enemy. On leaving Nimes I resolved to spend the carnival at Aix, where the nobility is of the most distinguished character. I believe I lodged at the \"Three Dolphins,\" where I found a Spanish cardinal on his way to Rome to elect a successor to Pope Rezzonico.',\n",
       " 'Chapter III My Stay at Aix; I Fall Ill--i Am Cared for by an Unknown Lady--the Marquis D\\'argens--cagliostro My room was only separated from his Castilian eminence\\'s by a light partition, and I could hear him quite plainly reprimanding his chief servant for being too economical. \"My lord, I do my best, but it is really impossible to spend more, unless I compel the inn–keepers to take double the amount of their bills; and your eminence will admit that nothing in the way of rich and expensive dishes has been spared. \" \"That may be, but you ought to use your wits a little; you might for example order meals when we shall not require any. Take care that there are always three tables—one for us, one for my officers, and the third for the servants. Why I see that you only give the postillions a franc over the legal charge, I really blush for you; you must give them a crown extra at least.',\n",
       " 'When they give you change for a louis, leave it on the table; to put back one\\'s change in one\\'s pocket is an action only worthy of a beggar. They will be saying at Versailles and Madrid, and maybe at Rome itself, that the Cardinal de la Cerda is a miser. I am no such thing, and I do not want to be thought one. You must really cease to dishonour me, or leave my service. \" A year before this speech would have astonished me beyond measure, but now I was not surprised, for I had acquired some knowledge of Spanish manners. I might admire the Senor de la Cerda\\'s prodigality, but I could not help deploring such ostentation on the part of a Prince of the Church about to participate in such a solemn function. What I had heard him say made me curious to see him, and I kept on the watch for the moment of his departure. What a man! He was not only ill made, short and sun–burnt; but his face was so ugly and so low that I concluded that AEsop himself must have been a little Love beside his eminence.',\n",
       " \"I understood now why he was so profuse in his generosity and decorations, for otherwise he might well have been taken for a stableboy. If the conclave took the eccentric whim of making him pope, Christ would never have an uglier vicar. I enquired about the Marquis d'Argens soon after the departure of his eminence, and was told that he was in the country with his brother, the Marquis d'Eguille, President of the Parliament, so I went there. This marquis, famous for his friendship for Frederick II. rather than for his writings (which are no longer read), was an old man when I saw him. He was a worthy man, fond of pleasure, a thorough–paced Epicurean, and had married an actress named Cochois, who had proved worthy of the honour he had laid on her. He was deeply learned and had a thorough knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew literature. He received me very well, and recalled what his friend the marshal had written about me.\",\n",
       " 'He introduced me to his wife and to his brother, a distinguished jurist, a man of letters, and a strictly moral man by temperament as much as religion. Though a highly intellectual man, he was deeply and sincerely religious. He was very fond of his brother, and grieved for his irreligion, but hoped that grace would eventually bring him back to the fold of the Church. His brother encouraged him in his hopes, while laughing at them in private, but as they were both sensible men they never discussed religion together. I was introduced to a numerous company of both sexes, chiefly consisting of relations. All were amiable and highly polished, like all the Provencal nobility. Plays were performed on the miniature stage, good cheer prevailed, and at intervals we walked in the garden, in spite of the weather. In Province, however, the winter is only severe when the wind blows from the north, which unfortunately often happens.',\n",
       " \"Among the company were a Berlin lady (widow of the marquis's nephew) and her brother. This young gentleman, who was gay and free from care, enjoyed all the pleasures of the house without paying any attention to the religious services which were held every day. If he thought on the matter at all, he was a heretic; and when the Jesuit chaplain was saying mass he amused himself by playing on the flute; he laughed at everything. He was unlike his sister, who had not only become a Catholic, but was a very devout one. Her brother told me that her husband, who had died of consumption, and whose mind was perfectly clear to the last, as is usually the case in phthisis, had told her that he could not entertain any hopes of seeing her in the other world unless she became a Catholic. These words were engraved on her heart; she had adored her husband, and she resolved to leave Berlin to live with his relations.\",\n",
       " \"No one ventured to oppose this design, her brother accompanying her, and she was welcomed joyfully by all her husband's kinsfolk. Her brother, finding me less strict than the others, soon constituted himself my friend. He came over to Aix every day, and took me to the houses of all the best people. We were at least thirty at table every day, the dishes were delicate without undue profusion, the conversation gay and animated without any improprieties. I noticed that whenever the Marquis d'Argens chanced to let slip any equivocal expressions, all the ladies made wry faces, and the chaplain hastened to turn the conversation. This chaplain had nothing jesuitical in his appearance; he dressed in the costume of an ordinary priest, and I should never had known him if the Marquis d'Argens had not warned me. However, I did not allow his presence to act as a wet blanket.\",\n",
       " 'I told, in the most decent manner possible, the story of the picture of the Virgin suckling her Divine Child, and how the Spaniards deserted the chapel after a stupid priest had covered the beautiful breast with a kerchief. I do not know how it was, but all the ladies began to laugh. The disciple of Loyola was so displeased at their mirth, that he took upon himself to tell me that it was unbecoming to tell such equivocal stories in public. I thanked him by an inclination of the head, and the Marquis d\\'Argens, by way of turning the conversation, asked me what was the Italian for a splendid dish of stewed veal, which Madame d\\'Argens was helping. \"Una crostata,\" I replied, \"but I really do not know the Italian for the \\'beatilles\\' with which it is stuffed. \" These \\'beatilles\\' were balls of rice, veal, champignons, artichoke, foie gras, etc. The Jesuit declared that in calling them \\'beatilles\\' I was making a mock of the glories of hereafter.',\n",
       " 'I could not help roaring with laughter at this, and the Marquis d\\'Eguille took my part, and said that \\'beatilles\\' was the proper French for these balls. After this daring difference of opinion with his director, the worthy man thought it would be best to talk of something else. Unhappily, however, he fell out of the frying–pan into the fire by asking me my opinion as to the election of the next pope. \"I believe it will be Ganganelli,\" I replied, \"as he is the only monk in the conclave. \" \"Why should it be necessary to choose a monk?\" \"Because none but a monk would dare to commit the excess which the Spaniards will demand of the new pope. \" \"I hope not, for the Jesuits were my masters, and I love them accordingly. But all the same Ganganelli will be elected, for an amusing and yet a weighty reason. \" \"He is the only cardinal who does not wear a wig; and you must consider that since the foundation of the Holy See the Pope has never been bewigged.',\n",
       " '\" This reason created a great deal of amusement; but the conversation was brought back to the suppression of the Jesuits, and when I told the company that I had heard from the Abbe Pinzi I saw the Jesuit turn pale. \"It seems that you have never been at a Jesuit seminary,\" I replied, \"for the dogma of the order is that the Pope can do everything, \\'et aliquid pluris\\'. \" This answer made everybody suppose me to be unaware that I was speaking to a Jesuit, and as he gave me no answer the topic was abandoned. After dinner I was asked to stay and see \\'Polieucte\\' played; but I excused myself, and returned to Aix with the young Berliner, who told me the story of his sister, and made me acquainted with the character of the society to which the Marquis d\\'Eguille was chiefly addicted. I felt that I could never adapt myself to their prejudices, and if it had not been for my young friend, who introduced me to some charming people, I should have gone on to Marseilles.',\n",
       " 'What with assemblies, balls, suppers, and the society of the handsome Provenqal ladies, I managed to spend the whole of the carnival and a part of Lent at Aix. I had made a present of a copy of the \"Iliad\" to the learned Marquis d\\'Argens; to his daughter, who was also a good scholar, I gave a Latin tragedy. The \"Iliad\" had Porphyry\\'s comment; it was a copy of a rare edition, and was richly bound. As the marquis came to Aix to thank me, I had to pay another visit to the country house. I had no cloak, and a cold north wind was blowing; I was perishing with cold, but instead of going to bed at once I accompanied the Berliner to the house of a woman who had a daughter of the utmost beauty. Though the girl was only fourteen, she had all the indications of the marriageable age, and yet none of the Provencal amateurs had succeeded in making her see daylight. My friend had already made several unsuccessful efforts.',\n",
       " \"I laughed at him, as I knew it was all a cheat, and I followed him to the house with the idea of making the young imposter dismount from her high horse, as I had done in similar cases in England and Metz. We set to work; and, far from resisting, the girl said she would be only too glad to get rid of the troublesome burden. I saw that the difficulty only proceeded from the way she held herself, and I ought to have whipped her, as I had done in Venice twenty–five years ago, but I was foolish enough to try to take the citadel by storm. I wearied myself to no purpose for a couple of hours, and then went to my inn, leaving the young Prussian to do his best. I went to bed with a pain in my side, and after six hours' sleep awoke feeling thoroughly ill. My landlord called in an old doctor, who refused to let me blood. A severe cough came on, and the next day I began to spit blood. In six or seven days the malady became so serious that I was confessed and received the last sacraments.\",\n",
       " 'On the tenth day, the disease having abated for three days, my clever old doctor answered for my life, but I continued to spit blood till the eighteenth day. My convalescence lasted for three weeks, and I found it more trying than the actual illness, for a man in pain has no time to grow weary. Throughout the whole case I was tended day and night by a strange woman, of whom I knew nothing. She nursed me with the tenderest care, and I awaited my recovery to give her my sincere thanks. She was not an old woman, neither was she attractive looking. After Eastertide, feeling I was well enough to venture out, I thanked her to the best of my ability, and asked who had sent her to me. She told me it was the doctor, and so bade me farewell. A few days later I was thanking my old doctor for having procured me such a capital nurse, but he stared at me and said he knew nothing about the woman.',\n",
       " 'I was puzzled, and asked my landlord if she could throw any light on the strange nurse\\'s identity; but she knew nothing, and her ignorance seemed universal. I could not discover whence or how she came to attend me. After my convalescence I took care to get all the letters which had been awaiting me, and amongst them was a letter from my brother in Paris, in answer to the epistle I wrote him from Perpignan. He acknowledged my letter, and told me how delighted he had been to receive it, after hearing the dreadful news that I had been assassinated on the borders of Catalonia at the beginning of January. \"The person who gave me the news,\" my brother added, \"was one of your best friends, Count Manucci, an attache at the Venetian embassy. He said there could be no doubt as to the truth of the report. This friend of mine had pushed his vengeance so far as to pay assassins to deprive me of my life. He must have been pretty well qualified to prophesy, as he was so certain of my death.',\n",
       " \"He might have known that in thus proclaiming in advance the manner of my death, he was also proclaiming himself as my murderer. I met him at Rome, two years later, and when I would have made him confess his guilt, he denied everything, saying he had received the news from Barcelona; however, we will speak of this in its proper place. I dined and supped every day at the table d'hote, and one day I heard the company talking of a male and female pilgrim who had recently arrived. They were said to be high–born folks, as they had distributed large alms on their entry into the town. It was said that the female pilgrim, who had gone to bed on her arrival, was charming. They were staying at the same inn as I was, and we all got very curious about them. As an Italian, I put myself at the head of the band who proceeded to call on the pilgrims, who, in my opinion, must either be fanatics or rogues. We found the lady sitting in an arm–chair, looking very tired.\",\n",
       " 'She was young, beautiful, and melancholy–looking, and in her hands she held a brass crucifix some six inches long. She laid it down when we came in, and got up and received us most graciously. Her companion, who was arranging cockle–shells on his black mantle, did not stir; he seemed to say, by glancing at his wife, that we must confine our attentions to her. He seemed a man of twenty–four or twenty–five years of age. He was short and badly hung, and his face bore all the indications of daring, impudence, sarcasm, and imposture. His wife, on the other hand, was all meekness and simplicity, and had that modesty which adds so much to the charm of feminine beauty. They only spoke just enough French to make themselves understood on their journey, and when they heard me addressing them in Italian they seemed much relieved. The lady told me she was a Roman, but I could have guessed as much from her accent.',\n",
       " 'Their passport, dated Rome, called him Balsamo, while she bore the names of Serafina Feliciani, which she still retains. Ten years later we shall hear more of this couple under the name of Cagliostro. \"We are going back to Rome,\" said she, \"well pleased with our devotions to St. We have walked the whole way on foot, living on alms, so as to more surely win the mercy of the God whom I have offended so grievously. We have had silver, and even gold money given us, and in every town we came to we gave what remained to the poor, so as not to offend God by lack of faith. \"My husband is strong, and has not suffered much, but I have found so much walking very fatiguing. We have slept on straw or bad beds, always with our clothes on, to avoid contracting diseases it would be hard to rid one\\'s self of. \" It seemed to me that this last circumstance was added to make us wish to find out whether the rest of her body could compare with her hands and arms in whiteness.',\n",
       " '\"Do you think of making any stay?\" \"My weariness will oblige us to stay here for three days; then we shall go to Rome by the way of Turin, where we shall pay our devotion to the Holy Sudary. \" \"You know, of course, that there are several of them in Europe. \" \"So we have heard, but we are assured that the Sudary of Turin is the true one. Veronica wiped the face of Our Lord, who left the imprint of His divine face upon it. \" We left them, well pleased with the appearance and manners of the lady pilgrim, but placing very little trust in her devotion. I was still weak from my illness, and she inspired me with no desires, but the rest would have gladly supped with her if they had thought there was anything to follow. Next day her husband asked me if I would come up and breakfast with them, or if they should come down and breakfast with me. It would have been impolite to have replied neither, so I said that I should be delighted to see them in my room.',\n",
       " 'At breakfast I asked the pilgrim what he did, and he replied that he was an artist. He could not design a picture, but he could copy it, and he assured me that he could copy an engraving so exactly that none could tell the copy from the original. If you are not a rich man, you are, at least, certain of earning a living with this talent. I have pursued this craft at Rome and at Naples, and found I had to work all day to make half a tester, and that\\'s not enough to live on. \" He then shewed me some fans he had done, and I thought them most beautiful. They were done in pen and ink, and the finest copper–plate could not have surpassed them. Next he showed me a copy from a Rembrandt, which if anything, was finer than the original. In spite of all he swore that the work he got barely supported him, but I did not believe what he said. He was a weak genius who preferred a vagabond life to methodical labour.',\n",
       " \"I offered a Louis for one of his fans, but he refused to take it, begging me to accept the fan as a gift, and to make a collection for him at the table d'hote, as he wanted to start the day after next. I accepted the present and promised to do as he desired, and succeeded in making up a purse of two hundred francs for them. She was asked to write her name on a lottery ticket, but refused, saying that no honest girls were taught to write at Rome. Everybody laughed at this excuse except myself, and I pitied her, as I could see that she was of very low origin. Next day she came and asked me to give her a letter of introduction for Avignon. Audifret the banker, and the other to the landlady of the inn. In the evening she returned me the letter to the banker, saying that it was not necessary for their purposes. At the same time she asked me to examine the letter closely, to see if it was really the same document I had given her. She laughed, and told me I was mistaken as it was only a copy.\",\n",
       " '\"Impossible!\" She called her husband, who came with the letter in his hand. I could doubt no longer, and said to him,— \"You are a man of talents, for it is much harder to imitate a handwriting than an engraving. You ought to make this talent serve you in good stead; but be careful, or it may cost you your life. In ten years I saw them again under the name of Count and Countess Pellegrini. At the present period he is in a prison which he will probably never leave, and his wife is happy, maybe, in a convent.',\n",
       " \"Chapter IV My Departure--letter From Henriette--marsellies--history of Nina--nice-- Turin--lugano--madame De**** As soon as I had regained my usual strength, I went to take leave of the Marquis d'Argens and his brother. I dined with them, pretending not to observe the presence of the Jesuit, and I then spent three delightful hours in conversation with the learned and amiable Marquis d'Argens. He told me a number of interesting anecdotes about the private life of Frederick II. No doubt the reader would like to have them, but I lack the energy to set them down. Perhaps some other day when the mists about Dux have dispersed, and some rays of the sun shine in upon me, I shall commit all these anecdotes to paper, but now I have not the courage to do so. Frederick had his good and his bad qualities, like all great men, but when every deduction on the score of his failings has been made, he still remains the noblest figure in the eighteenth century.\",\n",
       " \"The King of Sweden, who has been assassinated, loved to excite hatred that he might have the glory of defying it to do its worst. He was a despot at heart, and he came to a despot's end. He might have foreseen a violent death, for throughout his life he was always provoking men to the point of despair. There can be no comparison between him and Frederick. The Marquis d'Argens made me a present of all his works, and on my asking him if I could congratulate myself on possessing the whole number, he said yes, with the exception of a fragment of autobiography which he had written in his youth, and which he had afterwards suppressed. Never give way to this temptation, if it assails you. If you once begin on this plan you are not only compelled to record all your vices and follies, but to treat them in the severe tone of a philosophical historian. You must not, of course, omit the good you may have done; and so praise and blame is mingled on every page.\",\n",
       " 'All the evil you say of yourself will be held for gospel, your peccadilloes will be made into crimes, and your good deeds will not only be received with incredulity, but you will be taxed with pride and vanity for having recorded them. Besides, if you write your memoirs, you make an enemy in every chapter if you once begin to tell the truth. A man should neither talk of himself nor write of himself, unless it be to refute some calumny or libel. \" I was convinced, and promised never to be guilty of such a folly, but in spite of that I have been writing memoirs for the last seven years, and though I repent of having begun, I have sworn to go on to the end. However, I write in the hope that my Memoirs may never see the light of day; in the first place the censure would not allow them to be printed, and in the second I hope I shall be strong–minded enough, when my last illness comes, to have all my papers burnt before my eyes.',\n",
       " 'If that be not the case I count on the indulgence of my readers, who should remember that I have only written my story to prevent my going mad in the midst of all the petty insults and disagreeables which I have to bear day by day from the envious rascals who live with me in this castle of Count Waldstein, or Wallenstein, at Dux. I write ten or twelve hours a day, and so keep black melancholy at bay. My readers shall hear more of my sufferings later on, if I do not die before I write them down. The day after Corpus Christi I left Aix for Marseilles. But here I must set down a circumstance that I had forgotten; I mean the procession of Corpus Christi. Everyone knows that this festival is celebrated with great ceremony all over Christendom; but at Aix these ceremonies are of such a nature that every man of sense must be shocked at my recital.',\n",
       " \"It is well known that this procession in honour of the Being of beings, represented under the sacramental forms, is followed by all the religious confraternities, and this is duly done at Aix; but the scandalous part of the ceremony is the folly and the buffoonery which is allowed in a rite which should be designed to stir up the hearts of men to awe and reverence their Creator. Instead of that, the devil, death, and the seven deadly sins, are impersonated in the procession. They are clad in the most absurd costumes, and make hideous contortions, beating and abusing each other in their supposed vexation at having to join in the Creator's praises. The people hoot and hiss them, the lower classes sing songs in derision of them, and play them all manner of tricks, and the whole scene is one of incredible noise, uproar, and confusion, more worthy of some pagan bacchanalia than a procession of Christian people.\",\n",
       " 'All the country–folk from five or six leagues around Aix pour into the town on that day to do honour to God. It is the only occasion of the kind, and the clergy, either knavish or ignorant, encourage all this shameful riot. The lower orders take it all in good faith, and anyone who raised any objection would run some risk, for the bishop goes in front of the saturnalia, and consequently it is all holy. I expressed my disapproval of the whole affair, as likely to bring discredit on religion, to a councillor of parliament, M. Marc; but he told me gravely that it was an excellent thing, as it brought no less than a hundred thousand francs into the town on the single day. I knew her real name, and remembering the message she had sent me by Marcoline I hoped to meet her in some assembly, being ready to adapt my conduct to hers. I had often heard her name mentioned, but I never allowed myself to ask any question, not wishing our old friendship to be suspected.',\n",
       " 'Believing her to be at her country house, I had resolved on paying her a visit, and had only stayed on at Aix so as to recover my health before seeing her. In due course I left Aix with a letter in my pocket for her, resolving to send it in, and to remain in my carriage till she asked me to get down. A man came to the door, took my letter, and said madam should have it without fail. She will be coming here in three weeks to spend the summer as usual. \" \"Will you let me write a letter?\" \"If you will get down you will find all the necessary materials in madam\\'s room. \" I went into the house, and to my extreme surprise found myself face to face with my nurse. \" \"How did you come to nurse me?\" \"If you will step upstairs I will tell you. \" Her story was as follows: \"Madam sent for me in haste, and told me to go and attend to you as if it were herself. She told me to say that the doctor had sent me if you asked any questions.',\n",
       " '\" \"Perhaps he was speaking the truth, but most likely he had received orders from madam. That\\'s all I know, but I wonder you haven\\'t seen her at Aix. \" \"She cannot see any company, for I have been everywhere. \" \"She does not see any company at her own house, but she goes everywhere. I must have seen her, and yet I do not think I could have passed her by unrecognized. You have been with her ten years?\" \"Yes, sir, as I had the honour of informing you. \" \"Has she changed? Has she had any sickness? Has she aged?\" \"Not at all. She has become rather stout, but I assure you you would take her for a woman of thirty. \" The woman went out, leaving me in astonishment, at the extraordinary situation in which I was placed. \"Ought I to return to Aix immediately?\" I asked myself. She has a town house, but does not see company, but she might surely see me: She loves me still. She cared for me all through my illness, and she would not have done so if she had become indifferent to me.',\n",

I resolved to write, and I told her in my letter that I should await her reply at Marseilles. I gave the letter to my late nurse, with some money to insure its being dispatched at once, and drove on to Marseilles where I alighted at an obscure inn, not wishing to be recognized. I had scarcely got out of my carriage when I saw Madame Schizza, Nina\\'s sister. They had been at Marseilles three or four days and were going to Leghorn. Madame Schizza was alone at the moment, her husband having gone out; and as I was full of curiosity I begged her to come up to my room while my dinner was getting ready. \"What is your sister doing? Is she still at Barcelona?\" \"Yes; but she will not be there long, for the bishop will not have her in the town or the diocese, and the bishop is stronger than the viceroy.',\n",

She will have to leave in a month for certain, but she is not much put out, as the viceroy is sure to keep her wherever she goes, and she may eventually succeed in ruining him. In the meanwhile she is revelling in the bad repute she has gained for her lover. \" \"I know something of her peculiarities; but she cannot dislike a man who has made her rich. Do you imagine this monster capable of any feelings of gratitude? She is not a human being, and no one knows her as I do. She has made the count commit a hundred acts of injustice so that all Spain may talk of her, and know that she has made herself mistress of his body and soul, and all he has. The worse his actions are, the more certain she feels that people will talk of her, and that is all she wants.',\n",
       " 'Her obligations to me are beyond counting, for she owes me all, even to her existence, and instead of continuing my husband in her service she has sent him about his business. \" \"Then I wonder how she came to treat me so generously. \" \"If you knew all, you would not feel grateful to her. \" \"She only paid for your keep at the inn and in prison to make people believe you were her lover, and to shame the count. All Barcelona knows that you were assassinated at her door, and that you were fortunate enough to run the fellow through. \" \"But she cannot have been the instigator of, or even the accomplice in, the plot for my assassination. \" \"I dare say, but everything in Nina is against nature. What I tell you is the bare truth, for I was a witness of it all. Whenever the viceroy visited her she wearied him with praise of your gallantry, your wit, your noble actions, comparing you with the Spaniards, greatly to their disadvantage.',\n",
       " '\"The count got impatient and told her to talk of something else, but she would not; and at last he went away, cursing your name. Two days before you came to grief he left her, saying,— \"\\'Valga me Dios! I will give you a pleasure you do not expect. \\' \"I assure you that when we heard the pistol–shot after you had gone, she remarked, without evincing the slightest emotion, that the shot was the pleasure her rascally Spaniard had promised her. \"\\'All the worse for the count,\\' she replied, \\'for his turn will come also. \\' \"Then she began laughing like a madcap; she was thinking of the excitement your death would cause in Barcelona. \"At eight o\\'clock the following day, your man came and told her that you had been taken to the citadel; and I will say it to her credit, she seemed relieved to hear you were alive. \" \"My man—I did not know that he was in correspondence with her. \" \"No, I suppose not; but I assure you the worthy man was very much attached to you.',\n",
       " 'She did not shew it me, but it no doubt contained instructions to supply you with everything. \"The man told us that he had seen your sword all red with blood, and that your cloak had a bullet hole through it. She was delighted, but do not think it was because she loved you; she was glad you had escaped that you might take your revenge. However, she was troubled by the pretext on which the count had had you arrested. \"Ricla did not come to see her that day, but he came the next day at eight o\\'clock, and the infamous creature received him with a smiling face. She told him she had heard he had imprisoned you, and that she was obliged to him, as he had, of course, done so to protect you from any fresh attempts on your life. \"He answered, dryly, that your arrest had nothing to do with anything that might have happened the night before.',\n",

He replied that the police were enquiring into the matter, but that so far they had neither found a dead man nor a wounded man, nor any traces of blood. All that had been found was Casanova\\'s hat, and this had been returned to him. \"I left them alone together till midnight, so I cannot say what further converse they may have had on the subject, but three or four days later everybody knew that you were imprisoned in the tower. \"Nina asked the count the reason of this severity in the evening, and he replied that your passports were thought to be forgeries, because you were in disgrace with the State Inquisitors, and therefore would not be in a position to get a passport from the Venetian ambassador.',\n",
       " 'On this supposition he said you had been placed in the tower, and if it proved to be a true one, you would be still more severely punished. \"This news disturbed us, and when we heard that Pogomas had been arrested we felt certain he had denounced you in revenge for your having procured his dismissal from Nina\\'s house. When we heard that he had been let out and sent to Genoa, we expected to hear of your being set at liberty, as the authorities must have been satisfied of the genuine character of your passports; but you were still shut up, and Nina did not know what to think, and the count would not answer her when she made enquiries about you. She had made up her mind to say no more about it, when at last we heard you had been set free and that your passports had been declared genuine. \"Nina thought to see you in the pit of the opera–house, and made preparations for a triumph in her box; but she was in despair when she heard no performance was to be given.',\n",
       " 'In the evening the count told her that your passports had been returned with the order to leave in three days. The false creature praised her lover\\'s prudence to his face, but she cursed him in her heart. \"She knew you would not dare to see her, and when you left without writing her a note, she said you had received secret orders not to hold any further communications with her. \"\\'If Casanova had had the courage to ask me to go with him, I would have gone,\\' said she. \"Your man told her of your fortunate escape from three assassins. In the evening she congratulated Ricla on the circumstance, but he swore he knew nothing about it. You may thank God from the bottom of your heart that you ever left Spain alive after knowing Nina. She would have cost you your life at last, and she punishes me for having given her life. \" \"What! Are you her mother?\" \"Yes; Nina, that horrible woman, is my daughter. \" \"That is the horrible part of it, everybody is right.',\n",
       " '\" \"Explain yourself!\" \"Yes, though it is to my shame. She is my sister and my daughter, for she is the daughter of my father. \" \"What! your father loved you?\" \"I do not know whether the scoundrel loved me, but he treated me as his wife. She is the daughter of the crime, and God knows she is sufficient punishment for it. My father died to escape her vengeance; may he also escape the vengeance of God. I should have strangled her in her cradle, but maybe I shall strangle her yet. \" I remained dumb at the conclusion of this dreadful story, which bore all the marks of truth. \"Does Nina know that you are her mother?\" \"Her own father told her the secret when she was twelve, after he had initiated her into the life she has been living ever since. He would have made her a mother in her turn if he had not killed himself the same year, maybe to escape the gallows. \" \"How did the Conte de Ricla fall in love with her?\" \"It is a short story and a curious one.',\n",
       " 'Two years ago she came to Barcelona from Portugal, and was placed in one of the ballets for the sake of her pretty face, for as to talents she had none, and could only do the rebaltade (a sort of skip and pirouette) properly. \"The first evening she danced she was loudly applauded by the pit, for as she did the rebaltade she shewed her drawers up to her waist. In Spain any actress who shews her drawers on the stage is liable to a fine of a crown. Nina knew nothing about this, and, hearing the applause, treated the audience to another skip of the same kind, but at the end of the ballet she was told to pay two crowns for her immodesty. What do you think she did to elude the law, and at the same time avenge herself?\" \"Danced badly, perhaps. \" \"She danced without any drawers at all, and did her rebdltade as before, which caused such an effervescence of high spirits in the house as had never been known at Barcelona.',\n",
       " '\"The Conte de Ricla had seen her from his box, and was divided between horror and admiration, and sent for the inspector to tell him that this impudent creature must be punished. \\' \"Presently Nina appeared in the viceroy\\'s box, and asked him, impudently, what he wanted with her. \"\\'You are an immodest woman, and have failed in your duty to the public. \\' \"\\'What have I done? \"\\'You performed the same skip as before. \\' \"\\'Yes, but I haven\\'t broken your law, for no one can have seen my drawers as I took the precaution not to put any on. What more can I do for your cursed law, which has cost me two crowns already? Just tell me. \\' \"The viceroy and the great personages around him had much ado to refrain from laughter, for Nina was really in the right, and a serious discussion of the violated law would have been ridiculous. \"The viceroy felt he was in a false position, and merely said that if she ever danced without drawers again she should have a month\\'s imprisonment on bread and water.',\n",
       " '\"A week after one of my husband\\'s ballets was given. It was so well received that the audience encored it with enthusiasm. Ricla gave orders that the public should be satisfied, and all the dancers were told they would have to reappear. \"Nina, who was almost undressed, told my husband to do as best he could, as she was not going to dance again. As she had the chief part my husband could not do without her, and sent the manager to her dressing– room. She pushed the poor man out with so much violence that he fell against the wall of the passage, head foremost. \"The manager told his piteous tale to the viceroy, who ordered two soldiers to bring her before him. This was his ruin; for Nina is a beautiful woman, and in her then state of undress she would have seduced the coldest of men.',\n",
       " '\"The count reproved her, but his voice and his manner were ill–assured, and growing bolder as she watched his embarrassment, Nina replied that he might have her torn to pieces if he liked, but she would not dance against her will, and nowhere in her agreement was it stipulated that she should dance twice in the same evening, whether for his pleasure or anyone else\\'s. She also expressed her anger at making her appear before him in a state of semi–nudity, and swore she would never forgive his barbarous and despotic conduct. Let me go away, or kill me if you like; do your worst on me, and you shall find that I am a Venetian and a free woman!\\' \"The viceroy sat astonished, and said she must be mad. He then summoned my husband and told him she was no longer in his service. Nina was told she was free, and could go where she would. \"She went back to her dressing–room and came to us, where she was living.',\n",
       " '\"The ballet went on without her, and the poor viceroy sat in a dream, for the poison had entered into his veins. \"Next day a wretched singer named Molinari called on Nina and told her that the viceroy was anxious to know whether she were really mad or not, and would like to see her in a country house, the name of which he mentioned: this was just what the wretched woman wanted. \"\\'Tell his highness,\\' she said to Molinari, \\'that I will come, and that he will find me as gentle as a lamb and as good as an angel. \\' \"This is the way in which the connection began, and she fathomed his character so astutely that she maintained her conquest as much with ill– treatment and severity as with her favours.

I am a widow, and well enough off to tell you that if you lack money you will find some ready for you in Henriette\\'s purse. Do not come back to Aix to see me, as your return might give rise to gossip; but if you chance to come here again after some time, we may meet, though not as old acquaintances.

I am grateful for the reticence you have observed, though Marcoline must have delivered the message I gave her. Farewell!\" I replied, accepting her offer to correspond, and I told her the whole story of my adventures. From her I received forty letters, in which the history of her life is given. If she die before me, I shall add these letters to my Memoirs, but at present she is alive and happy, though advanced in years.

She gave me a capital dinner, and her husband made me offers which I was ashamed to accept. I had fifty Louis, and, intending to go on to Turin, I did not feel uneasy about the future. At Marseilles I met the Duc de Vilardi, who was kept alive by the art of Tronchin. This nobleman, who was Governor of Provence, asked me to supper, and I was surprised to meet at his house the self–styled Marquis d'Aragon; he was engaged in holding the bank.\",\n",

I left Marseilles by myself, and after crossing the Alps arrived at Turin. There I had a warm welcome from the Chevalier Raiberti and the Comte de la Perouse. Both of them pronounced me to be looking older, but I consoled myself with the thought that, after all, I was only forty–four. I became an intimate friend of the English ambassador, Sir N―, a rich, accomplished and cultured man, who kept the choicest of tables.

With this I should be able to print the book I had composed in my prison; but I should have to rewrite it \\'ab initio\\', with the volume to my hand, as also the \"History of Venice,\" by Nani.

He reserved the right of censorship, expressing a hope that our opinions might coincide. I gave him the preface and the preliminary matter at once, and chose the paper and the size, large octavo.

I had been persecuted by the Venetian Government, so no one could accuse me of being partial; and by my exposing the calumnies of Amelot before all Europe I hoped to gain a reward, which after all would only be an act of justice.

As to the calumny, he protested he had only repeated common rumour, and professed his joy at finding it had been mistaken.

He added that the work would be examined, and in the mean time the ambassador was instructed to shew me no signal marks of favour lest the Court should suppose he was protecting me as a Venetian. Nevertheless, it was the same tribunal that had facilitated my access to the ambassador to Madrid—Mocenigo.\",\n",
       " \"I told Berlendis that my visits should be limited in number, and free from all ostentation. I was much interested in his son's tutor; he was a priest, a man of letters, and a poet. His name was Andreis, and he is now resident in England, where he enjoys full liberty, the greatest of all blessings. I spent my time at Turin very pleasantly, in the midst of a small circle of Epicureans; there were the old Chevalier Raiberti, the Comte de la Perouse, a certain Abbe Roubien, a delightful man, the voluptuous Comte de Riva, and the English ambassador. To the amusements which this society afforded I added a course of reading, but no love affairs whatever. While I was at Turin, a milliner, Perouse's mistress, feeling herself in 'articulo mortis', swallowed the portrait of her lover instead of the Eucharist. This incident made me compose two sonnets, which pleased me a good deal at the time, and with which I am still satisfied.\",\n",
       " 'No doubt some will say that every poet is pleased with his own handiwork, but as a matter of fact, the severest critic of a sensible author is himself. The Russian squadron, under the command of Count Alexis Orloff, was then at Leghorn; this squadron threatened Constantinople, and would probably have taken it if an Englishman had been in command. As I had known Count Orloff in Russia, I imagined that I might possibly render myself of service to him, and at the same time make my fortune. The English ambassador having given me a letter for the English consul, I left Turin with very little money in my purse and no letter of credit on any banker. An Englishman named Acton commended me to an English banker at Leghorn, but this letter did not empower me to draw any supplies. Acton was just then involved in a curious complication. When he was at Venice he had fallen in love with a pretty woman, either a Greek or a Neapolitan.',\n",
       " 'The husband, by birth a native of Turin, and by profession a good–for–nothing, placed no obstacle in Acton\\'s way, as the Englishman was generous with his money; but he had a knack of turning up at those moments when his absence would have been most desirable. The generous but proud and impatient Englishman could not be expected to bear this for long. He consulted with the lady, and determined to shew his teeth. The husband persisted in his untimely visits, and one day Acton said, dryly,— \"Do you want a thousand guineas? You can have them if you like, on the condition that your wife travels with me for three years without our having the pleasure of your society. \" The husband thought the bargain a good one, and signed an agreement to that effect. After the three years were over the husband wrote to his wife, who was at Venice, to return to him, and to Acton to put no obstacle in the way.',\n",
       " 'The lady replied that she did not want to live with him any more, and Acton explained to the husband that he could not be expected to drive his mistress away against her will. He foresaw, however, that the husband would complain to the English ambassador, and determined to be before–handed with him. In due course the husband did apply to the English ambassador, requesting him to compel Acton to restore to him his lawful wife. He even asked the Chevalier Raiberti to write to the Commendatore Camarana, the Sardinian ambassador at Venice, to apply pressure on the Venetian Government, and he would doubtless have succeeded if M. However, as it was he did nothing of the sort, and even gave Acton a warm welcome when he came to Turin to look into the matter. He had left his mistress at Venice under the protection of the English consul.',\n",
       " \"The husband was ashamed to complain publicly, as he would have been confronted with the disgraceful agreement he had signed; but Berlendis maintained that he was in the right, and argued the question in the most amusing manner. On the one hand he urged the sacred and inviolable character of the marriage rite, and on the other he shewed how the wife was bound to submit to her husband in all things. I argued the matter with him myself, shewing him his disgraceful position in defending a man who traded on his wife's charms, and he was obliged to give in when I assured him that the husband had offered to renew the lease for the same time and on the same terms as before. Two years later I met Acton at Bologna, and admired the beauty whom he considered and treated as his wife. I left Turin for Parma with a Venetian who, like myself, was an exile from his country. He had turned actor to gain a livelihood; and was going to Parma with two actresses, one of whom was interesting.\",\n",
       " 'As soon as I found out who he was, we became friends, and he would have gladly made me a partner in all his amusements, by the way, if I had been in the humour to join him. This journey to Leghorn was undertaken under the influence of chimerical ideas. I thought I might be useful to Count Orloff, in the conquest he was going to make, as it was said, of Constantinople. I fancied that it had been decreed by fate that without me he could never pass through the Dardanelles. In spite of the wild ideas with which my mind was occupied, I conceived a warm friendship for my travelling companion, whose name was Angelo Bentivoglio. The Government never forgave him a certain crime, which to the philosophic eye appears a mere trifle. In four years later, when I describe my stay at Venice, I shall give some further account of him. About noon we reached Parma, and I bade adieu to Bentivoglio and his friends.',\n",
       " 'The Court was at Colorno, but having nothing to gain from this mockery of a court, and wishing to leave for Bologna the next morning, I asked Dubois–Chateleraux, Chief of the Mint, and a talented though vain man, to give me some dinner. The reader will remember that I had known him twenty two years before, when I was in love with Henriette. He was delighted to see me, and seemed to set great store by my politeness in giving him the benefit of my short stay at Parma. I told him that Count Orloff was waiting for me at Leghorn, and that I was obliged to travel day and night. \"He will be setting sail before long,\" said he; \"I have advices from Leghorn to that effect. \" I said in a mysterious tone of voice that he would not sail without me, and I could see that my host treated me with increased respect after this. He wanted to discuss the Russian Expedition, but my air of reserve made him change the conversation.',\n",
       " 'At dinner we talked a good deal about Henriette, whom he said he had succeeded in finding out; but though he spoke of her with great respect, I took care not to give him any information on the subject. He spent the whole afternoon in uttering complaints against the sovereigns of Europe, the King of Prussia excepted, as he had made him a baron, though I never could make out why. He cursed the Duke of Parma who persisted in retaining his services, although there was no mint in existence in the duchy, and his talents were consequently wasted there. I listened to all his complaints, and agreed that Louis XV. had been ungrateful in not conferring the Order of St. Michael on him; that Venice had rewarded his services very shabbily; that Spain was stingy, and Naples devoid of honesty, etc. When he had finished, I asked him if he could give me a bill on a banker for fifty sequins.',\n",
       " \"He replied in the most friendly manner that he would not give me the trouble of going to a banker for such a wretched sum as that; he would be delighted to oblige me himself. I took the money promising to repay him at an early date, but I have never been able to do so. I do not know whether he is alive or dead, but if he were to attain the age of Methuselah I should not entertain any hopes of paying him; for I get poorer every day, and feel that my end is not far off. The next day I was in Bologna, and the day after in Florence, where I met the Chevalier Morosini, nephew of the Venetian procurator, a young man of nineteen, who was travelling with Count Stratico, professor of mathematics at the University of Padua. He gave me a letter for his brother, a Jacobin monk, and professor of literature at Pisa, where I stopped for a couple of hours on purpose to make the celebrated monk's acquaintance.\",\n",
       " 'I found him even greater than his fame, and promised to come again to Pisa, and make a longer stay for the purpose of enjoying his society. I stopped an hour at the Wells, where I made the acquaintance of the Pretender to the throne of Great Britain, and from there went on to Leghorn, where I found Count Orloff still waiting, but only because contrary winds kept him from sailing. The English consul, with whom he was staying, introduced me at once to the Russian admiral, who received me with expressions of delight. He told me he would be charmed if I would come on board with him. He told me to have my luggage taken off at once, as he would set sail with the first fair wind. When he was gone the English consul asked me what would be my status with the admiral. \"That\\'s just what I mean to find out before embarking my effects. \" \"You won\\'t be able to speak to him till to–morrow.',\n",
       " '\" Next morning I called on Count Orloff, and sent him in a short note, asking him to give me a short interview before I embarked my mails. An officer came out to tell me that the admiral was writing in bed, and hoped I would wait. \" I had been waiting a few minutes, when Da Loglio, the Polish agent at Venice and an old friend of mine, came in. \"What are you doing here, my dear Casanova?\" said he. \" After this, Da Loglio coolly went into the admiral\\'s room. This was impertinent of him; it was as if he said in so many words that the admiral was too busy to see me, but not too busy to see him. A moment after, Marquis Manucci came in with his order of St. He congratulated me on my visit to Leghorn, and then said he had read my work on Venice, and had been surprised to find himself in it. He had some reason for surprise, for there was no connection between him and the subject–matter; but he should have discovered before that the unexpected often happens.',\n",
       " 'He did not give me time to tell him so, but went into the admiral\\'s room as Da Loglio had done. I was vexed to see how these gentlemen were admitted while I danced attendance, and the project of sailing with Orloff began to displease me. In five hours Orloff came out followed by a numerous train. He told me pleasantly that we could have our talk at table or after dinner. He came in and sat down at two o\\'clock, and I was among the guests. Orloff kept on saying, \"Eat away, gentlemen, eat away;\" and read his correspondence and gave his secretary letters all the time. After dinner he suddenly glanced up at me, and taking me by the hand led me to the window, and told me to make haste with my luggage, as he should sail before the morning if the wind kept up. \"Quite so; but kindly tell me, count, what is to be my status or employment an board your ship?\" \"At present I have no special employ to give you; that will come in time.',\n",
       " '\" \"The offer is an honourable one so far as you are concerned, but all the other officers might treat me with contempt. I should be regarded as a kind of fool, and I should probably kill the first man who dared to insult me. Give me a distinct office, and let me wear your uniform; I will be useful to you. I know the country for which you are bound, I can speak the language, and I am not wanting in courage. \" \"My dear sir, I really have no particular office to give you. \" \"Then, count, I wish you a pleasant sail; I am going to Rome. I hope you may never repent of not taking me, for without me you will never pass the Dardanelles. \" Such was the short dialogue I had with the worthy count, who, as a matter of fact, did not pass the Dardanelles. Whether he would have succeeded if I had been on board is more than I can say.',\n",
       " 'The day after I went to Pisa, and spent a pleasant week in the company of Father Stratico, who was made a bishop two or three years after by means of a bold stroke that might have ruined him. He delivered a funeral oration over Father Ricci, the last general of the Jesuits. The Pope, Ganganelli, had the choice of punishing the writer and increasing the odium of many of the faithful, or of rewarding him handsomely. I saw the bishop some years later, and he told me in confidence that he had only written the oration because he felt certain, from his knowledge of the human heart, that his punishment would be a great reward. This clever monk initiated me into all the charms of Pisan society. He had organized a little choir of ladies of rank, remarkable for their intelligence and beauty, and had taught them to sing extempore to the guitar. He had had them instructed by the famous Gorilla, who was crowned poetess–laureate at the capitol by night, six years later.',\n",
       " 'She was crowned where our great Italian poets were crowned; and though her merit was no doubt great, it was, nevertheless, more tinsel than gold, and not of that order to place her on a par with Petrarch or Tasso. She was satirised most bitterly after she had received the bays; and the satirists were even more in the wrong than the profaners of the capitol, for all the pamphlets against her laid stress on the circumstance that chastity, at all events, was not one of her merits. All poetesses, from the days of Homer to our own, have sacrificed on the altar of Venus. No one would have heard of Gorilla if she had not had the sense to choose her lovers from the ranks of literary men; and she would never have been crowned at Rome if she had not succeeded in gaining over Prince Gonzaga Solferino, who married the pretty Mdlle. Rangoni, daughter of the Roman consul, whom I knew at Marseilles, and of whom I have already spoken.',\n",
       " 'This coronation of Gorilla is a blot on the pontificate of the present Pope, for henceforth no man of genuine merit will accept the honour which was once so carefully guarded by the giants of human intellect. Two days after the coronation Gorilla and her admirers left Rome, ashamed of what they had done. The Abbe Pizzi, who had been the chief promoter of her apotheosis, was so inundated with pamphlets and satires that for some months he dared not shew his face. This is a long digression, and I will now return to Father Stratico, who made the time pass so pleasantly for me. Though he was not a handsome man, he possessed the art of persuasion to perfection; and he succeeded in inducing me to go to Sienna, where he said I should enjoy myself. He gave me a letter of introduction for the Marchioness Chigi, and also one for the Abbe Chiaccheri; and as I had nothing better to do I went to Sienna by the shortest way, not caring to visit Florence.',\n",
       " 'The Abbe Chiaccheri gave me a warm welcome, and promised to do all he could to amuse me; and he kept his word. He introduced me himself to the Marchioness Chigi, who took me by storm as soon as she had read the letter of the Abbe Stratico, her dear abbe, as she called him, when she read the superscription in his writing. The marchioness was still handsome, though her beauty had begun to wane; but with her the sweetness, the grace, and the ease of manner supplied the lack of youth. She knew how to make a compliment of the slightest expression, and was totally devoid of any affection of superiority. \"So you are going to stay a week, I see, from the dear abbe\\'s letter. That\\'s a short time for us, but perhaps it may be too long for you. I hope the abbe has not painted us in too rosy colours. \" \"He only told me that I was to spend a week here, and that I should find with you all the charms of intellect and sensibility. \" \"Stratico should have condemned you to a month without mercy.',\n",
       " '\" \"Why mercy? What hazard do I run?\" \"Of being tired to death, or of leaving some small morsel of your heart at Sienna. \" \"All that might happen in a week, but I am ready to dare the danger, for Stratico has guarded me from the first by counting on you, and from the second by counting on myself. My heart will go forth from Sienna as free as it came, for I have no hope of victory, and defeat would make me wretched. \" \"Is it possible that you are amongst the despairing?\" \"Yes, and to that fact I owe my happiness. \" \"It would be a pity for you if you found yourself mistaken. \\'Tis likewise the motto of that finished voluptuary, Horace, but I only take it because it suits me. The pleasure which follows desires is the best, for it is the most acute. \"True, but it cannot be calculated on, and defies the philosopher. May God preserve you, madam, from finding out this painful truth by experience! The highest good lies in enjoyment; desire too often remains unsatisfied.',\n",
       " 'If you have not yet found out the truth of Horace\\'s maxim, I congratulate you. \" The amiable marchioness smiled pleasantly and gave no positive answer. Chiaccheri now opened his mouth for the first time, and said that the greatest happiness he could wish us was that we should never agree. The marchioness assented, rewarding Chiaccheri with a smile, but I could not do so. \"I had rather contradict you,\" I said, \"than renounce all hopes of pleasing you. The abbe has thrown the apple of discord between us, but if we continue as we have begun I shall take up my abode at Sienna. \" The marchioness was satisfied with the sample of her wit which she had given me, and began to talk commonplaces, asking me if I should like to see company and enjoy society of the fair sex. \"I want to leave Sienna with the feeling that you are the only lady to whom I have done homage, and that the Abbe Chiaccheri has been my only guide.',\n",
       " '\" The marchioness was flattered, and asked the abbe and myself to dine with her on the following day in a delightful house she had at a hundred paces from the town. The older I grew the more I became attached to the intellectual charms of women. With the sensualist, the contrary takes place; he becomes more material in his old age: requires women well taught in Venus\\'s shrines, and flies from all mention of philosophy. As I was leaving her I told the abbe that if I stayed at Sienna I would see no other woman but her, come what might, and he agreed that I was very right. The abbe shewed me all the objects of interest in Sienna, and introduced me to the literati, who in their turn visited me. The same day Chiaccheri took me to a house where the learned society assembled. It was the residence of two sisters—the elder extremely ugly and the younger very pretty, but the elder sister was accounted, and very rightly, the Corinna of the place.',\n",
       " 'She asked me to give her a specimen of my skill, promising to return the compliment. I recited the first thing that came into my head, and she replied with a few lines of exquisite beauty. I complimented her, but Chiaccheri (who had been her master) guessed that I did not believe her to be the author, and proposed that we should try bouts rimes. The pretty sister gave out the rhymes, and we all set to work. The ugly sister finished first, and when the verses came to be read, hers were pronounced the best. I was amazed, and made an improvisation on her skill, which I gave her in writing. In five minutes she returned it to me; the rhymes were the same, but the turn of the thought was much more elegant. I was still more surprised, and took the liberty of asking her name, and found her to be the famous \"Shepherdess,\" Maria Fortuna, of the Academy of Arcadians. I had read the beautiful stanzas she had written in praise of Metastasio.',\n",
       " \"I told her so, and she brought me the poet's reply in manuscript. Full of admiration, I addressed myself to her alone, and all her plainness vanished. I had had an agreeable conversation with the marchioness in the morning, but in the evening I was literally in an ecstacy. I kept on talking of Fortuna, and asked the abbe if she could improvise in the manner of Gorilla. He replied that she had wished to do so, but that he had disallowed it, and he easily convinced me that this improvisation would have been the ruin of her fine talent. I also agreed with him when he said that he had warned her against making impromptus too frequently, as such hasty verses are apt to sacrifice wit to rhyme. The honour in which improvisation was held amongst the Greeks and Romans is due to the fact that Greek and Latin verse is not under the dominion of rhyme. But as it was, the great poets seldom improvised; knowing as they did that such verses were usually feeble and common–place.\",\n",
       " 'Horace often passed a whole night searching for a vigorous and elegantly–turned phrase. When he had succeeded, he wrote the words on the wall and went to sleep. The lines which cost him nothing are generally prosaic; they may easily be picked out in his epistles. The amiable and learned Abbe Chiaccheri, confessed to me that he was in love with his pupil, despite her ugliness. He added that he had never expected it when he began to teach her to make verses. \"I can\\'t understand that,\" I said, \"sublata lucerna\\', you know. \" \"Not at all,\" said he, with a laugh, \"I love her for her face, since it is inseparable from my idea of her. \" A Tuscan has certainly more poetic riches at his disposal than any other Italian, and the Siennese dialect is sweeter and more energetic than that of Florence, though the latter claims the title of the classic dialect, on account of its purity. This purity, together with its richness and copiousness of diction it owes to the academy.',\n",
       " 'From the great richness of Italian we can treat a subject with far greater eloquence than a French writer; Italian abounds in synonyms, while French is lamentably deficient in this respect. Voltaire used to laugh at those who said that the French tongue could not be charged with poverty, as it had all that was necessary. The obstinacy of the French academy in refusing to adopt foreign words skews more pride than wisdom. As for us we take words from all languages and all sources, provided they suit the genius of our own language. We love to see our riches increase; we even steal from the poor, but to do so is the general characteristic of the rich. The amiable marchioness gave us a delicious dinner in a house designed by Palladio. Chiaccheri had warned me to say nothing about the Shepherdess Fortuna; but at dinner she told him she was sure he had taken me to her house. He had not the face to deny it, and I did not conceal the pleasure I had received.',\n",
       " '\"Stratico admires Fortuna,\" said the marchioness, \"and I confess that her writings have great merit, but it\\'s a pity one cannot go to the house, except under an incognito. \"What!\" said she to the abbe, \"you did not tell him whose house it is?\" \"I did not think it necessary, her father and mother rarely shew themselves. \" \"But what is her father?\" I asked, \"the hangman, perhaps?\" \"Worse, he\\'s the \\'bargello\\', and you must see that a stranger cannot be received into good society here if he goes to such places as that. \" Chiaccheri looked rather hurt, and I thought it my duty to say that I would not go there again till the eve of my departure. \"I saw her sister once,\" said the marchioness; \"she is really charmingly pretty, and it\\'s a great pity that with her beauty and irreproachable morality she should be condemned to marry a man of her father\\'s class.',\n",
       " '\" \"I once knew a man named Coltellini,\" I replied; \"he is the son of the bargello of Florence, and is poet–in–ordinary to the Empress of Russia. I shall try to make a match between him and Fortuna\\'s sister; he is a young man of the greatest talents. \" The marchioness thought my idea an excellent one, but soon after I heard that Coltellini was dead. The \\'bargello\\' is a cordially–detested person all over Italy, if you except Modena, where the weak nobility make much of the \\'bargello\\', and do justice to his excellent table. This is a curious fact, for as a rule these bargellos are spies, liars, traitors, cheats, and misanthropes, for a man despised hates his despisers. At Sienna I was shewn a Count Piccolomini, a learned and agreeable man. He had a strange whim, however, of spending six months in the year in the strictest seclusion in his own house, never going out and never seeing any company; reading and working the whole time.',\n",
       " 'He certainly did his best to make up for his hibernation during the other six months in the year. The marchioness promised she would come to Rome in the course of the summer. She had there an intimate friend in Bianconi who had abandoned the practice of medicine, and was now the representative of the Court of Saxony. On the eve of my departure, the driver who was to take me to Rome came and asked me if I would like to take a travelling companion, and save myself three sequins. \" \"Is she by herself?\" \"No, she is with a gentleman on horseback, who wishes to ride all the way to Rome. \" \"Then how did the girl come here?\" \"On horseback, but she is tired out, and cannot bear it any longer. The gentleman has offered me four sequins to take her to Rome, and as I am a poor man I think you might let me earn the money. \" \"I suppose he will follow the carriage?\" \"He can go as he likes; that can\\'t make much difference to either of us. \" \"I have been told so, but I haven\\'t seen her myself.',\n",
       " '\" \"What sort of a man is her companion?\" \"He\\'s a fine man, but he can speak very little Italian. \" \"Has he sold the lady\\'s horse?\" \"No, it was hired. He has only one trunk, which will go behind the carriage. I shall not give any decision before speaking to this man. \" Directly afterwards, a brisk–looking young fellow, carrying himself well enough, and clad in a fancy uniform, came in. He told me the tale I had heard from the coachman, and ended by saying that he was sure I would not refuse to accommodate his wife in my carriage. \"Your wife, sir?\" I saw he was a Frenchman, and I addressed him in French. \" The next morning when I got into my carriage, I found her already there. I paid her some slight compliment, and sat down beside her, and we drove off.',\n",

There is nothing particularly out of the common in having a fellow–traveller in one's carriage; this time, however, the affair had something decidedly romantic about it. I was forty–five, and my purse contained two hundred sequins. I still loved the fair sex, though my ardour had decreased, my experience had ripened, and my caution increased. I was more like a heavy father than a young lover, and I limited myself to pretensions of the most modest character. The young person beside me was pretty and gentle–looking, she was neatly though simply dressed in the English fashion, she was fair and small, and her budding breast could be seen outlined beneath the fine muslin of her dress. She had all the appearances of modesty and noble birth, and something of virginal innocence, which inspired one with attachment and respect at the same time.\",\n",
       " '\" \"I congratulate myself on having you for my travelling companion. \" \"Yes, but I will never do such a foolish thing again. \" \"I think your husband would have been wise to sell his horse and buy a carriage. \" \"You like travelling?\" \"Very much, but with greater comfort. \" With these words the English girl, whose white skin did not look as if it could contain a drop of blood, blushed most violently. I guessed something of her secret, and begged pardon; and for more than an hour I remain silent, pretending to gaze at the scenery, but in reality thinking of her, for she began to inspire me with a lively interest. Though the position of my young companion was more than equivocal, I determined to see my way clearly before I took any decisive step; and I waited patiently till we got to Bon Couvent, where we expected to dine and meet the husband. In Italy the carriages never go faster than a walk; a man on foot can outstrip them, as they rarely exceed three miles an hour.',\n",

The English girl was astonished at not finding her husband, and looked for him in all directions. I noticed her, and asked the landlord what had become of him. He informed us that he had breakfasted and baited his horse, and had then gone on, leaving word that he would await us at St. The poor girl begged me to excuse her husband\\'s behaviour. \"He has given me a mark of his confidence, madam, and there is nothing to be offended at. \" The landlord asked me if the vetturino paid my expenses, and I answered in the negative; and the girl then told him to ask the vetturino if he was paying for her.',\n",
       " 'The man came in, and to convince the lady that providing her with meals was not in the contract, he gave her a paper which she handed to me to read. \" When she was alone with me my young companion begged me only to order dinner for myself. I understood her delicacy, and this made her all the dearer to me. \"Madame,\" said I, \"you must please look upon me as an old friend. I guess you have no money about you, and that you wish to fast from motives of delicacy. If I told the landlord to only prepare dinner for myself I should be dishonouring the count, yourself possibly, and myself most of all. Let dinner be served for two, then; but I cannot eat, for I feel ill, and I hope you will not mind my lying on the bed for a moment. This is a pleasant room, and they can lay the table in the next.

       " 'I had ceased to believe the Frenchman to be the beautiful Englishwoman\\'s husband, and began to think I should have to fight him. The case, I felt certain, was one of elopement and seduction; and, superstitious as usual, I was sure that my good genius had sent me in the nick of time to save her and care for her, and in short to snatch her from the hands of her infamous deceiver. I laughed at the absurd title the rascal had given himself, and when the thought struck me that he had possibly abandoned her to me altogether, I made up my mind that he deserved hanging. I lay down on the bed, and as I built a thousand castles in the air I fell asleep. The landlady awoke me softly, saying that three o\\'clock had struck. \" I opened the door gently, and saw she was still asleep, but as I closed the door after me the noise awoke her, and she asked if I had dined. \"I shall not take any dinner, madam, unless you do me the honour to dine with me.',\n",

She was agreeably surprised to see the beefsteaks and plum pudding, which I had ordered for her. When the landlady came in, she asked her if the cook was an Englishman, and when she heard that I had given directions for the preparation of her national dishes, she seemed full of gratitude. She cheered up, and congratulated me on my appetite, while I encouraged her to drink some excellent Montepulciano and Montefiascone. By dessert she was in good spirits, while I felt rather excited. She told me, in Italian, that she was born in London, and I thought I should have died with joy, in reply to my question whether she knew Madame Cornelis, she replied that she had known her daughter as they had been at school together.',\n",

How long ago is it since you have seen her?\" \"Eighteen months; she went back to her mother\\'s, to be married as it was said, but I don\\'t know to whom. \" The landlord brought me the bill, and I saw a note of three pains which her husband had spent on himself and his horse. I was delighted to see her blushing, it proved she was not a party to her husband\\'s proceedings. I was burning with the desire to know how she had left London and had met the Frenchman, and why they were going to Rome; but I did not want to trouble her by my questions, and I loved her too well already to give her any pain. We had a three hours\\' drive before us, so I turned the conversation to Sophie, with whom she had been at school.',\n",
       " '\"Was Miss Nancy Steyne there when you left?\" said I. The reader may remember how fond I had been of this young lady, who had dined with me, and whom I had covered with kisses, though she was only twelve. My companion sighed at hearing the name of Nancy, and told me that she had left. \"Was she pretty when you knew her?\" \"She was a beauty, but her loveliness was a fatal gift to her. Nancy was a close friend of mine, we loved each other tenderly; and perhaps our sympathy arose from the similarity of the fate in store for us. Nancy, too loving and too simple, is now, perhaps, even more unhappy than myself. \" \"More unhappy? What do you mean?\" \"Alas!\" \"Is it possible that fate has treated you harshly? Is it possible that you can be unhappy with such a letter of commendation as nature has given you?\" \"Alas! let us speak of something else. I pitied her in secret, and led the conversation back to Nancy.',\n",
       " '\" \"She ran away with a young man she loved; they despaired of gaining the parents\\' consent to the match. Since her flight nothing has been heard of her, and you see I have some reason to fear that she is unhappy. I would willingly give my life if it could be the saving of her. She and Sophie dined with me, and her father came in at the end of the meal. I heard that you had gone to Russia, and had fought a duel with a general in Poland. Is this true? How I wish I could tell dear Sophie all this, but I may not entertain such hopes now. \" \"You have heard the truth about me; but what should prevent you writing what you like to England? I take a lively interest in you, trust in me, and I promise you that you shall communicate with whom you please. \" With these words she became silent, and I left her to her thoughts.',\n",
       " \"Quirico, and the so–called Comte de l'Etoile came out and welcomed his wife in the most loving fashion, kissing her before everybody, no doubt with the object of giving people to understand that she was his wife, and I her father. The girl responded to all his caresses, looking as if a load had been lifted off her breast, and without a word of reproach she went upstairs with him, having apparently forgotten my existence. I set that down to love, youth, and the forgetfulness natural to that early age. I went upstairs in my turn with my carpet bag, and supper was served directly, as we had to start very early the next morning if we wished to reach Radicofani before the noonday heat. We had an excellent supper, as the count had preceded us by six hours, and the landlord had had plenty of time to make his preparations. The English girl seemed as much in love with de l'Etoile as he with her, and I was left completely out in the cold.\",\n",
       " 'I cannot describe the high spirits, the somewhat risky sallies, and the outrageous humours of the young gentleman; the girl laughed with all her heart, and I could not help laughing too. I considered that I was present at a kind of comedy, and not a gesture, not a word, not a laugh did I allow to escape me. \"He may be merely a rich and feather–brained young officer,\" I said to myself, \"who treats everything in this farcical manner. They are amusing, but frivolous, and sometimes dangerous, wearing their honour lightly, and too apt to carry it at the sword\\'s point. \" On this hypothesis I was ill pleased with my position. I did not much like his manner towards myself; he seemed to be making a dupe of me, and behaved all the while as if he were doing me an honour. On the supposition that the Englishwoman was his wife, his treatment of myself was certainly not warranted, and I was not the man to play zero.',\n",
       " 'I could not disguise the fact, however, that any onlooker would have pronounced me to be playing an inferior part. There were two beds in the room where we had our supper. When the chambermaid came to put on the sheets, I told her to give me another room. The count politely begged me to sleep in the same room with them, and the lady remained neutral; but I did not much care for their company, and insisted on leaving them alone. I had my carpet bag taken to my room, wished them a good night and locked myself in. My friends had only one small trunk, whence I concluded that they had sent on their luggage by another way; but they did not even have the trunk brought up to their room. I went to bed tranquilly, feeling much less interested about the lady than I had been on the journey. I was roused early in the morning, and made a hasty toilette. I could hear my neighbours dressing, so I half opened my door, and wished them good day without going into their room.',\n",
       " 'In a quarter of an hour I heard the sound of a dispute in the court– yard, and on looking out, there were the Frenchman and the vetturino arguing hotly. The vetturino held the horse\\'s bridle, and the pretended count did his best to snatch it away from him. I guessed the bone of contention: the Frenchman had no money, and the vetturino asked in vain for his due. I knew that I should be drawn into the dispute, and was making up my mind to do my duty without mercy, when the Count de l\\'Etoile came in and said,— \"This blockhead does not understand what I say to him; but as he may have right on his side, I must ask you to give him two sequins. By an odd chance I happen to have no money about me, but the fellow might trust me as he has got my trunk. However, he says he must be paid, so will you kindly oblige me? You shall hear more of me at Rome. \" Without waiting for me to reply, the rascal went out and ran down the stairs.',\n",
       " 'I put my head out of the window, and saw him leap on horseback and gallop away. I sat down on my bed, and turned the scene over in my mind, rubbing my hands gently. At last I went off into a mad roar of laughter; it struck me as so whimsical and original an adventure. \"Laugh too,\" said I to the lady, \"laugh or I will never get up. \" \"I agree with you that it\\'s laughable enough, but I have not the spirit to laugh. \" I gave the poor devil of a vetturino two sequins, telling him that I should like some coffee and to start in a quarter of an hour. \"I understand your grief,\" said I, \"but you must try to overcome it. I have only one favour to ask of you, and if you refuse to grant me that, I shall be as sad as you, so we shall be rather a melancholy couple. \" \"What can I do for you?\" \"You can tell me on your word of honour whether that extraordinary character is your husband, or only your lover. \" \"I will tell you the simple truth; he is not my husband, but we are going to be married at Rome.',\n",
       " 'He never shall be your husband, and so much the better for you. He has seduced you, and you love him, but you will soon get over that. I am sure he has told you that he is rich, that he is a man of rank, and that he will make you happy; and all that is a lie. \" \"How can you know all this?\" \"Experience—experience is my great teacher. Your lover is a young feather–brain, a man of no worth. He might possibly marry you, but it would be only to support himself by the sale of your charms. \" \"Yes, he loves you, but not with the love of a man of honour. Without knowing my name, or my character, or anything about me, he delivered you over to my tender mercies. A man of any delicacy would never abandon his loved one thus. \" \"A man of honour is the same in France, and England, and Italy, and all the world over. If he loved you, would he have left you penniless in this fashion? What would you do, if I were inclined to play the brutal lover? You may speak freely.',\n",
       " '\" \"Very good; then I should abandon you here, and what would you do then? You are pretty, you are a woman of sensibility, but many men would take but little account of your virtue. Your lover has left you to me; for all he knew I might be the vilest wretch; but as it is, cheer up, you have nothing to fear. \"How can you think that adventurer loves you? He is a mere monster. I am sorry that what I say makes you weep, but it must be said. I even dare tell you that I have taken a great liking to you; but you may feel quite sure that I shall not ask you to give me so much as a kiss, and I will never abandon you. Before we get to Rome I shall convince you that the count, as he calls himself, not only does not love you, but is a common swindler as well as a deceiver. \" \"You will convince me of that?\" \"Yes, on my word of honour! Dry your eyes, and let us try to make this day pass as pleasantly as yesterday. You cannot imagine how glad I feel that chance has constituted me your protector.',\n",
       " 'I want you to feel assured of my friendship, and if you do not give me a little love in return, I will try and bear it patiently. \" The landlord came in and brought the bill for the count and his mistress as well as for myself. I had expected this, and paid it without a word, and without looking at the poor wandering sheep beside me. I recollected that too strong medicines kill, and do not cure, and I was afraid I had said almost too much. I longed to know her history, and felt sure I should hear it before we reached Rome. We took some coffee and departed, and not a word passed between us till we got to the inn at La Scala, where we got down. The road from La Scala to Radicofani is steep and troublesome. The vetturino would require an extra horse, and even then would have taken four hours. I decided, therefore, to take two post horses, and not to begin the journey till ten o\\'clock. \"Would it not be better to go on now?\" said the English girl; \"it will be very hot from ten till noon.',\n",
       " '\" \"Yes, but the Comte de l\\'Ltoile, whom we should be sure to meet at Radicofani, would not like to see me. \" If I had told her my reason she would have wept anew, so in pity I spared her. I saw that she was blinded by love, and could not see the true character of her lover. It would be impossible to cure her by gentle and persuasive argument; I must speak sharply, the wound must be subjected to the actual cautery. But was virtue the cause of all this interest? Was it devotion to a young and innocent girl that made me willing to undertake so difficult and so delicate a task? Doubtless these motives went for something, but I will not attempt to strut in borrowed plumes, and must freely confess that if she had been ugly and stupid I should probably have left her to her fate. In short, selfishness was at the bottom of it all, so let us say no more about virtue. My true aim was to snatch this delicate morsel from another\\'s hand that I might enjoy it myself.',\n",
       " 'I did not confess as much to myself, for I could never bear to calmly view my own failings, but afterwards I came to the conclusion that I acted a part throughout. Is selfishness, then, the universal motor of our actions? I am afraid it is. I made Betty (such was her name) take a country walk with me, and the scenery there is so beautiful that no poet nor painter could imagine a more delicious prospect. Betty spoke Tuscan with English idioms and an English accent, but her voice was so silvery and clear that her Italian was delightful to listen to. I longed to kiss her lips as they spoke so sweetly, but I respected her and restrained myself. We were walking along engaged in agreeable converse, when all at once we heard the church bells peal out. Betty said she had never seen a Catholic service, and I was glad to give her that pleasure.',\n",
       " \"It was the feast day of some local saint, and Betty assisted at high mass with all propriety, imitating the gestures of the people, so that no one would have taken her for a Protestant. After it was over, she said she thought the Catholic rite was much more adapted to the needs of loving souls than the Angelican. She was astonished at the southern beauty of the village girls, whom she pronounced to be much handsomer that the country lasses in England. She asked me the time, and I replied without thinking that I wondered she had not got a watch. She blushed and said the count had asked her to give it him to leave in pawn for the horse he hired. I was sorry for what I had said, for I had put Betty, who was incapable of a lie, to great pain. We started at ten o'clock with three horses, and as a cool wind was blowing we had a pleasant drive, arriving at Radicofani at noon.\",\n",
       " 'The landlord, who was also the postmaster, asked if I would pay three pauls which the Frenchman had expended for his horse and himself, assuring the landlord that his friend would pay. For Betty\\'s sake I said I would pay; but this was not all. \"The gentleman,\" added the man, \"has beaten three of my postillions with his naked sword. One of them was wounded in the face, and he has followed his assailant, and will make him pay dearly for it. The reason of the assault was that they wanted to detain him till he had paid. \" \"You were wrong to allow violence to be used; he does not look like a thief, and you might have taken it for granted that I should pay. \" \"You are mistaken; I was not obliged to take anything of the sort for granted; I have been cheated in this sort many times before. She observed a distressed silence; and I tried to raise her spirits, and to make her eat a good dinner, and to taste the excellent Muscat, of which the host had provided an enormous flask.',\n",
       " 'All my efforts were in vain, so I called the vetturino to tell him that I wanted to start directly after dinner. \"You mean to go as far as Centino, I suppose,\" said the man. \" \"No, we must push on, as the lady\\'s husband may be in need of help. The wounded postillion has followed him; and as he speaks Italian very imperfectly, there\\'s no knowing what may happen to him. \" Betty looked at me with the utmost gratitude; and by way of proving it, she pretended to have a good appetite. She had noticed that this was a certain way of pleasing me. While we were at dinner I ordered up one of the beaten postillions, and heard his story. He was a frank rogue; he said he had received some blows with the flat of the sword, but he boasted of having sent a stone after the Frenchman which must have made an impression on him.',\n",
       " \"I gave him a Paul, and promised to make it a crown if he would go to Centino to bear witness against his comrade, and he immediately began to speak up for the count, much to Betty's amusement. He said the man's wound in the face was a mere scratch, and that he had brought it on himself, as he had no business to oppose a traveller as he had done. By way of comfort he told us that the Frenchman had only been hit by two or three stones. Betty did not find this very consoling, but I saw that the affair was more comic than tragic, and would end in nothing. The postillion went off, and we followed him in half an hour. Betty was tranquil enough till we got there, and heard that the count had gone on to Acquapendente with the two postillions at his heels; she seemed quite vexed. I told her that all would be well; that the count knew how to defend himself; but she only answered me with a deep sigh.\",\n",
       " 'I suspected that she was afraid we should have to pass the night together, and that I would demand some payment for all the trouble I had taken. \"Would you like us to go on to Acquapendente?\" I asked her. At this question her face beamed all over; she opened her arms, and I embraced her. The fellow replied that his horses were in the stable, and that he was not going to put them in; but that I could have post horses if I liked. \" It is my belief that, if I had liked, Betty would have given me everything at that moment, for she let herself fall into my arms. I pressed her tenderly and kissed her, and that was all She seemed grateful for my self–restraint. The horses were put in, and after I had paid the landlord for the supper, which he swore he had prepared for us, we started. We reached Acquapendente in three quarters of an hour, and we found the madcap count in high spirits. He embraced his Dulcinea with transports, and Betty seemed delighted to find him safe and sound.',\n",
       " 'He told us triumphantly that he had beaten the rascally postillions, and had warded their stones off. \"He is drinking to my health with his comrade; they have both begged my pardon. \" \"Yes,\" said Betty, \"this gentleman gave him a crown. \" \"What a pity! You shouldn\\'t have given them anything. \" Before supper the Comte de l\\'Etoile skewed us the bruises on his thighs and side; the rascal was a fine well–made fellow. However, Betty\\'s adoring airs irritated me, though I was consoled at the thought of the earnest I had received from her. Next day, the impudent fellow told me that he would order us a good supper at Viterbo, and that of course I would lend him a sequin to pay for his dinner at Montefiascone. So saying, he skewed me in an off–hand way a bill of exchange on Rome for three thousand crowns. I did not trouble to read it, and gave him the sequin, though I felt sure I should never see it again. Betty now treated me quite confidentially, and I felt I might ask her almost any questions.',\n",
       " 'When we were at Montefiascone she said,— \"You see my lover is only without money by chance; he has a bill of exchange for a large amount. \" \"Not at all; I only wish I were mistaken, but I am sure of the contrary. Twenty years ago I should have taken it for a good one, but now it\\'s another thing, and if the bill is a good one, why did he not negotiate it at Sienna, Florence, or Leghorn?\" \"It may be that he had not the time; he was in such a hurry to be gone. Ah! if you knew all!\" \"I only want to know what you like to tell me, but I warn you again that what I say is no vague suspicion but hard fact. \" \"Then you persist in the idea that he does not love me. \" \"Nay, he loves you, but in such a fashion as to deserve hatred in return. \" \"How do you mean?\" \"Would you not hate a man who loved you only to traffic in your charms?\" \"I should be sorry for you to think that of him. \" \"If you like, I will convince you of what I say this evening.',\n",
       " '\" \"You will oblige me; but I must have some positive proof. It would be a sore pain to me, but also a true service. \" \"And when you are convinced, will you cease to love him?\" \"Certainly; if you prove him to be dishonest, my love will vanish away. \" \"You are mistaken; you will still love him, even when you have had proof positive of his wickedness. He has evidently fascinated you in a deadly manner, or you would see his character in its true light before this. \" \"All this may be true; but do you give me your proofs, and leave to me the care of shewing that I despise him. \" \"I will prove my assertions this evening; but tell me how long you have known him?\" \"About a month; but we have only been together for five days. \" \"And before that time you never accorded him any favours?\" \"Not a single kiss. He was always under my windows, and I had reason to believe that he loved me fondly.',\n",
       " '\" \"Oh, yes! he loves you, who would not? but his love is not that of a man of honour, but that of an impudent profligate. \" \"But how can you suspect a man of whom you know nothing?\" \"Would that I did not know him! I feel sure that not being able to visit you, he made you visit him, and then persuaded you to fly with him. \" \"And who is to answer for his constancy?\" \"His love is my surety. \" \"Did he take you from a father, a lover, or a brother?\" \"From a lover, who will not be back at Leghorn for a week or ten days. \" \"Where has he gone?\" \"To London on business; I was under the charge of a woman whom he trusted. Tell me if you love your Englishman, and if he is worthy of your love. \" \"Alas! I loved him dearly till I saw this Frenchman, who made me unfaithful to a man I adored. He will be in despair at not finding me when he returns. \" \"Is he rich?\" \"Not very; he is a business man, and is comfortably off. He is a man of your age, and a thoroughly kind and honest person.',\n",
       " 'He was waiting for his consumptive wife to die to marry me. \" \"Poor man! Have you presented him with a child?\" \"No. I am sure God did not mean me for him, for the count has conquered me completely. \" \"Everyone whom love leads astray says the same thing. \" \"Now you have heard everything, and I am glad I told you, for I am sure you are my friend. \" \"I will be a better friend to you, dear Betty, in the future than in the past. You will need my services, and I promise not to abandon you. I love you, as I have said; but so long as you continue to love the Frenchman I shall only ask you to consider me as your friend. \" \"I accept your promise, and in return I promise not to hide anything from you. \" \"I escaped on horseback, but my trunk, which is full of linen and other effects, will be at Rome two days after us. I sent it off the day before my escape, and the man who received it was sent by the count.',\n",
       " '\" \"Then good–bye to your trunk!\" \"Why, you foresee nothing but misfortune!\" \"Well, dear Betty, I only wish my prophecies may not be accomplished. Although you escaped on horseback I think you should have brought a cloak and a carpet bag with some linen. \" \"All that is in the small trunk; I shall have it taken into my room tonight. \" We reached Viterbo at seven o\\'clock, and found the count very cheerful. In accordance with the plot I had laid against the count, I began by shewing myself demonstratively fond of Betty, envying the fortunate lover, praising his heroic behaviour in leaving her to me, and so forth. The silly fellow proceeded to back me up in my extravagant admiration. He boasted that jealousy was utterly foreign to his character, and maintained that the true lover would accustom himself to see his mistress inspire desires in other men.',\n",
       " 'He proceeded to make a long dissertation on this theme, and I let him go on, for I was waiting till after supper to come to the conclusive point. During the meal I made him drink, and applauded his freedom from vulgar prejudices. At dessert he enlarged on the duty of reciprocity between lovers. \"Thus,\" he remarked, \"Betty ought to procure me the enjoyment of Fanny, if she has reason to think I have taken a fancy to her; and per contra, as I adore Betty, if I found that she loved you I should procure her the pleasure of sleeping with you. \" Betty listened to all this nonsense in silent astonishment. \"I confess, my dear count,\" I replied, \"that, theoretically speaking, your system strikes me as sublime, and calculated to bring about the return of the Golden Age; but I am afraid it would prove absurd in practice. No doubt you are a man of courage, but I am sure you would never let your mistress be enjoyed by another man.',\n",
       " 'I will wager that amount that you will not allow me to sleep with your wife. I\\'ll bet fifty sequins that I will remain in the room a calm spectator of your exploits. My dear Betty, we must punish this sceptic; go to bed with him. \" \"Not at all; to bed with you, I shall love you all the more. \" \"You must be crazy, I shall do nothing of the kind. \" The count took her in his arms, and caressing her in the tenderest manner begged her to do him this favour, not so much for the twenty–five Louis, as to convince me that he was above vulgar prejudices. His caresses became rather free, but Betty repulsed him gently though firmly, saying that she would never consent, and that he had already won the bet, which was the case; in fine the poor girl besought him to kill her rather than oblige her to do a deed which she thought infamous. Her words, and the pathetic voice with which they were uttered, should have shamed him, but they only put him into a furious rage.',\n",
       " \"He repulsed her, calling her the vilest names, and finally telling her that she was a hypocrite, and he felt certain she had already granted me all a worthless girl could grant. Betty grew pale as death, and furious in my turn, I ran for my sword. I should probably have run him through, if the infamous scoundrel had not fled into the next room, where he locked himself in. I was in despair at seeing Betty's distress, of which I had been the innocent cause, and I did my best to soothe her. Her breath came with difficulty, her eyes seemed ready to start out of her head, her lips were bloodless and trembling, and her teeth shut tight together. I could not call for help, and all I could do was to dash water in her face, and speak soothing words. At last she fell asleep, and I remained beside her for more than two hours, attentive to her least movements, and hoping that she would awake strengthened and refreshed. At day–break I heard l'Etoile going off, and I was glad of it.\",\n",
       " 'The people of the inn knocked at our door, and then Betty awoke. \"Are you ready to go, my dear Betty?\" \"I am much better, but I should so like a cup of tea. \" The Italians cannot make tea, so I took what she gave me, and went to prepare it myself. When I came back I found her inhaling the fresh morning air at the window. She drank a few cups of tea (of which beverage the English are very fond), and soon regained her good looks. She heard some people in the room where we had supped, and asked me if I had taken up the purse which I had placed on the table. I found my purse and a piece of paper bearing the words, \"bill of exchange for three thousand crowns. \" The impostor had taken it out of his pocket in making his bet, and had forgotten it. It was dated at Bordeaux, drawn on a wine merchant at Paris to l\\'Etoile\\'s order. I took it to Betty, who told me she knew nothing about bills, and begged me to say nothing more about that infamous fellow.',\n",
       " 'She then said, in a voice of which I can give no idea,— \"For pity\\'s sake do not abandon a poor girl, more worthy of compassion than blame!\" I promised her again to have all a father\\'s care for her, and soon after we proceeded on our journey. The poor girl fell asleep, and I followed her example. We were awoke by the vetturino who informed us, greatly to our astonishment, that we were at Monterosi. We had slept for six hours, and had done eighteen miles. We had to stay at Monterosi till four o\\'clock, and we were glad of it, for we needed time for reflection. In the first place I asked about the wretched deceiver, and was told that he had made a slight meal, paid for it, and said he was going to spend the night at La Storta. We made a good dinner, and Betty plucking up a spirit said we must consider the case of her infamous betrayer, but for the last time. \"Be a father to me,\" said she; \"do not advise but command; you may reckon on my obedience.',\n",
       " 'I have no need to give you any further particulars, for you have guessed all except the horror with which the thought of my betrayer now inspires me. If it had not been for you, he would have plunged me into an abyss of shame and misery. \" \"Can you reckon on the Englishman forgiving you?\" \"I think so. Are you strong enough to follow this counsel? I warn you that if you approve of it, it must be put into execution at once. Young, pretty, and virtuous as you are, you need not imagine that I shall allow you to go by yourself, or in the company of strangers. If you think I love you, and find me worthy of your esteem, that is sufficient regard for me. I will live with you like a father, if you are not in a position to give me marks of a more ardent affection. Be sure I will keep faith with you, for I want to redeem your opinion of men, and to shew you that there are men as honourable as your seducer was vile.',\n",
       " '\" Betty remained for a quarter of an hour in profound silence, her head resting on her elbows, and her eyes fixed on mine. She did not seem either angry or astonished, but as far as I could judge was lost in thought. I was glad to see her reflective, for thus she would be able to give me a decided answer: At last she said: \"You need not think, my dear friend, that my silence proceeds from irresolution. If my mind were not made up already I should despise myself. I am wise enough at any rate to appreciate the wisdom of your generous counsels. I thank Providence that I have fallen into the hands of such a man who will treat me as if I were his daughter. \" \"Then we will go back to Leghorn, and start immediately. \" \"My only doubt is how to manage my reconciliation with Sir B― M―. I have no doubt he will pardon me eventually; but though he is tender and good–hearted he is delicate where a point of honour is concerned, and Subject to sudden fits of violence.',\n",
       " 'This is what I want to avoid; for he might possibly kill me, and then I should be the cause of his ruin. \" \"You must consider it on the way, and tell me any plans you may think of. \" \"He is an intelligent man, and it would be hopeless to endeavour to dupe him by a lie. I must make a full confession in writing without hiding a single circumstance; for if he thought he was being duped his fury would be terrible. If you will write to him you must not say that you think me worthy of forgiveness; you must tell him the facts and leave him to judge for himself. He will be convinced of my repentance when he reads the letter I shall bedew with my tears, but he must not know of my whereabouts till he has promised to forgive me. He is a slave to his word of honour, and we shall live together all our days without my ever hearing of this slip. \" \"You must not be offended if I ask you whether you have ever given him like cause for complaint before.',\n",
       " '\" \"What is his history?\" \"He lived very unhappily with his first wife; and he was divorced from his second wife for sufficient reasons. Two years ago he came to our school with Nancy\\'s father, and made my acquaintance. My father died, his creditors seized everything, and I had to leave the school, much to Nancy\\'s distress and that of the other pupils. At this period Sir B― M― took charge of me, and gave me a sum which placed me beyond the reach of, want for the rest of my days. I was grateful, and begged him to take me with him when he told me he was leaving England. He was astonished; and, like a man of honour, said he loved me too well to flatter himself that we could travel together without his entertaining more ardent feelings for me than those of a father. He thought it out of the question for me to love him, save as a daughter. \"This declaration, as you may imagine, paved the way for a full agreement.',\n",
       " '\" \"\\'However you love me,\\' I said, \\'I shall be well pleased, and if I can do anything for you I shall be all the happier. \\' \"He then gave me of his own free will a written promise to marry me on the death of his wife. We started on our travels, and till my late unhappy connection I never gave him the slightest cause for complaint. \" \"Dry your eyes, dear Betty, he is sure to forgive you. I have friends at Leghorn, and no one shall find out that we have made acquaintance. I will put you in good hands, and I shall not leave the town till I hear you are back with Sir B― M―. If he prove inexorable I promise never to abandon you, and to take you back to England if you like. \" \"But how can you spare the time?\" \"I will tell you the truth, my dear Betty. I have nothing particular to do at Rome, or anywhere else. \" \"How can I shew my gratitude to you?\" I summoned the vetturino, and told him we must return to Viterbo.',\n",
       " \"He objected, but I convinced him with a couple of piastres, and by agreeing to use the post horses and to spare his own animals. We got to Viterbo by seven o'clock, and asked anxiously if no one had found a pocket–book which I pretended I had lost. I was told no such thing had been found, so I ordered supper with calmness, although bewailing my loss. I told Betty that I acted in this sort to obviate any difficulties which the vetturino might make about taking us back to Sienna, as he might feel it his duty to place her in the hands of her supposed husband. I had up the small trunk, and after we had forced the lock Betty took out her cloak and the few effects she had in it, and we then inspected the adventurer's properties, most likely all he possessed in the world.\",\n",
       " 'A few tattered shirts, two or three pairs of mended silk stockings, a pair of breeches, a hare\\'s foot, a pot of grease, and a score of little books–plays or comic operas, and lastly a packet of letters; such were the contents of the trunk. We proceeded to read the letters, and the first thing we noted was the address: \"To M. L\\'Etoile, Actor, at Marseilles, Bordeaux, Bayonne, Montpellier, etc. She saw herself the dupe of a vile actor, and her indignation and shame were great. \"We will read it all to–morrow,\" said I; \"to–day we have something else to do. We got over our supper hastily, and then Betty begged me to leave her alone for a few moments for her to change her linen and go to bed. \"If you like,\" said I, \"I will have a bed made up for me in the next room.',\n",
       " '\" \"No, dear friend, ought I not to love your society? What would have become of me without you?\" I went out for a few minutes, and when I returned and came to her bedside to wish her good night, she gave me such a warm embrace that I knew my hour was come. I was happy, and I had reason to believe that Betty was happy also. In the morning, we had just fallen asleep, when the vettuyino knocked at the door. \"Listen,\" I said, \"it is absolutely necessary for me to recover my pocket–book, and I hope to find it at Acquapendente. \" \"Very good, sir, very good,\" said the rogue, a true Italian, \"pay me as if I had taken you to Rome, and a sequin a day for the future, and if you like, I will take you to England on those terms. \" The vetturino was evidently what is called wide awake. At seven o\\'clock we stopped at Montefiascone to write to Sir B― M―, she in English, and I in French. Betty had now an air of satisfaction and assurance which I found charming.',\n",
       " 'She said she was full of hope, and seemed highly amused at the thought of the figure which the actor would cut when he arrived at Rome by himself. She hoped that we should come across the man in charge of her trunk, and that we should have no difficulty in getting it back. \" \"I expect not, but if he does I will give him a warm welcome. If he does not take himself off I will blow out his brains. \"Not even the reward you gave me?\" \"Oh, yes! That is a little secret between ourselves. \" In less than three hours the letters were composed and written. Betty was satisfied with my letter; and her own, which she translated for my benefit, was a perfect masterpiece of sensibility, which seemed to me certain of success. I thought of posting from Sienna, to ensure her being in a place of safety before the arrival of her lover.',\n",
       " \"The only thing that troubled me was the bill of exchange left behind by l'Etoile, for whether it were true or false, I felt bound to deal with it in some way, but I could not see how it was to be done. We set out again after dinner in spite of the heat, and arrived at Acquapendente in the evening and spent the night in the delights of mutual love. As I was getting up in the morning I saw a carriage in front of the inn, just starting for Rome. I imagined that amidst the baggage Betty's trunk might be discovered, and I told her to get up, and see if it were there. We went down, and Betty recognized the trunk she had confided to her seducer. We begged the vetturino to restore it to us, but he was inflexible; and as he was in the right we had to submit. The only thing he could do was to have an embargo laid on the trunk at Rome, the said embargo to last for a month. A notary was called, and our claim properly drawn up.\",\n",
       " 'The vetturino, who seemed an honest and intelligent fellow, assured us he had received nothing else belonging to the Comte de l\\'Etoile, so we were assured that the actor was a mere beggar on the lookout for pickings, and that the rags in the small trunk were all his possessions. After this business had been dispatched Betty brightened up amazingly. My mistake will serve as a warning to me for the future, for the lesson has been a severe one, and might have been much worse if I had not had the good fortune of meeting you. \" \"I congratulate you,\" I replied, \"on having cured yourself so quickly of a passion that had deprived you of your reason. I shudder when I think of the monster; but I verily believe that I should not have regained my senses if he had not called me a hypocrite, and said that he was certain I had already granted you my favours. These infamous words opened my eyes, and made me see my shame.',\n",
       " 'I believe I would have helped you to pierce him to the heart if the coward had not run away. But I am glad he did run away, not for his sake but for ours, for we should have been in an unpleasant position if he had been killed. \" \"You are right; he escaped my sword because he is destined for the rope. \" \"Let him look to that himself, but I am sure he will never dare to shew his face before you or me again. \" We reached Radicofani at ten o\\'clock, and proceeded to write postscripts to our letters to Sir B― M― We were sitting at the same table, Betty opposite to the door and I close to it, so that anyone coming in could not have seen me without turning round. Betty was dressed with all decency and neatness, but I had taken off my coat on account of the suffocating heat. Nevertheless, though I was in shirt sleeves, I should not have been ashamed of my attire before the most respectable woman in Italy. All at once I heard a rapid step coming along the passage, and the door was dashed open.',\n",
       " 'A furious–looking man came in, and, seeing Betty, cried out,— \"Ah! there you are. \" I did not give him time to turn round and see me, but leapt upon him and seized him by the shoulders. If I had not done so he would have shot me dead on the spot. As I leapt upon him I had involuntarily closed the door, and as he cried, \"Let me go, traitor!\" Betty fell on her knees before him, exclaiming, \"No, no! he is my preserver. \" Sir B― M― was too mad with rage to pay any attention to her, and kept on,― \"Let me go, traitors!\" As may be imagined, I did not pay much attention to this request so long as the loaded pistol was in his hand. In our struggles he at last fell to the ground and I on top of him. The landlord and his people had heard the uproar, and were trying to get in; but as we had fallen against the door they could not do so. Betty had the presence of mind to snatch the pistol from his hand, and I then let him go, calmly observing, \"Sir, you are labouring under a delusion.',\n",
       " '\" Again Betty threw herself on her knees, begging him to calm himself, as I was her preserver not her betrayer. \"What do you mean by \\'preserver\\'?\" said B― M― Betty gave him the letter, saying,— \"Read that. \" The Englishman read the letter through without rising from the ground, and as I was certain of its effect I opened the door and told the landlord to send his people away, and to get dinner for three, as everything had been settled.']"

       " \"Chapter I I Am Ordered to Leave Vienna--the Empress Moderates but Does Not Annul the Order--zavoiski at Munich--my Stay at Augsburg--gasconnade at Louisburg--the Cologne Newspaper--my Arrival at Aix-la-chapelle The greatest mistake a man that punishes a knave can commit is to leave the said rogue alive, for he is certain to take vengeance. If I had had my sword in the den of thieves, I should no doubt have defended myself, but it would have gone ill with me, three against one, and I should probably have been cut to pieces, while the murderers would have escaped unpunished. At eight o'clock Campioni came to see me in my bed, and was astonished at my adventure. Without troubling himself to compassionate me, we both began to think how we could get back my purse; but we came to the conclusion that it would be impossible, as I had nothing more than my mere assertion to prove the case.\",\n",
       " 'In spite of that, however, I wrote out the whole story, beginning with the girl who recited the Latin verses. I intended to bring the document before the police; however, I had not time to do so. I was just sitting down to dinner, when an agent of the police came and gave me an order to go and speak to Count Schrotembach, the Statthalter. I told him to instruct my coachman, who was waiting at the door, and that I would follow him shortly. When I called on the Statthalter, I found him to be a thick–set individual; he was standing up, and surrounded by men who seemed ready to execute his orders. When he saw me, he shewed me a watch, and requested me to note the hour. \" \"If you are at Vienna at that time to–morrow I shall have you expelled from the city. \" \"Why do you give me such an unjust order?\" \"In the first place, I am not here to give you accounts or reasons for my actions.',\n",
       " 'However, I may tell you that you are expelled for playing at games of chance, which are forbidden by the laws under pain of the galleys. Do you recognize that purse and these cards?\" I did not know the cards, but I knew the purse which had been stolen from me. I was in a terrible rage, and I only replied by presenting the magistrate with the truthful narrative of what had happened to me. He read it, and then said with a laugh that I was well known to be a man of parts, that my character was known, that I had been expelled from Warsaw, and that as for the document before him he judged it to be a pack of lies, since in his opinion it was altogether void of probability. \"In fine,\" he added, \"you will obey my order to leave the town, and you must tell me where you are going. \" \"I will tell you that when I have made up my mind to go. \" \"What? You dare to tell me that you will not obey?\" \"You yourself have said that if I do not go I shall be removed by force.',\n",
       " 'I have heard you have a strong will, but here it will be of no use to you. I advise you to go quietly, and so avoid harsh measures. Begone!\" This was one of the most terrible moments of my life. It was only a cowardly love of life that hindered me from running my sword through the body of the Statthalter, who had treated me as if he were a hangman and not a judge. As I went away I took it into my head to complain to Prince Kaunitz, though I had not the honour of knowing him. I called at his house, and a man I met told me to stay in the ante–chamber, as the prince would pass through to go to dinner. The prince appeared, followed by his guests, amongst whom was M. The prince asked me what he could do for me, and I told my story in a loud voice before them all. \"I have received my order to go, but I shall not obey. I implore your highness to give me your protection, and to help me to bring my plea to the foot of the throne.',\n",
       " '\" \"Write out your petition,\" he replied, \"and I will see that the empress gets it. But I advise you to ask her majesty for a respite, for if you say that you won\\'t obey, she will be predisposed against you. \" \"But if the royal grace does not place me in security, I shall be driven away by violence. \" \"Then take refuge with the ambassador of your native country. An act of legal though unconstitutional violence has deprived me of my rights as a citizen. \" The prince looked astonished and turned to the Venetian ambassador, who smiled, and whispered to him for ten minutes. \"It\\'s a pity,\" said the prince, kindly, \"that you cannot claim the protection of any ambassador. \" At these words a nobleman of colossal stature stepped forward and said I could claim his protection, as my whole family, myself included, had served the prince his master. He spoke the truth, for he was the ambassador of Saxony. \"Write to the empress, and I will forward your petition immediately.',\n",
       " 'If there is any delay in the answer, go to the count; you will be safe with him, until you like to leave Vienna. \" In the meanwhile the prince ordered writing materials to be brought me, and he and his guests passed into the dining–hall. I give here a copy of the petition, which I composed in less than ten minutes. I made a fair copy for the Venetian ambassador to send home to the Senate: \"MADAM,—I am sure that if, as your royal and imperial highness were walking in your garden, an insect appealed plaintively to you not to crush it, you would turn aside, and so avoid doing the poor creature any hurt. \"I, madam, am an insect, and I beg of you that you will order M. Statthalter Schrotembach to delay crushing me with your majesty\\'s slipper for a week.',\n",
       " 'Possibly, after that time has elapsed, your majesty will not only prevent his crushing me, but will deprive him of that slipper, which was only meant to be the terror of rogues, and not of an humble Venetian, who is an honest man, though he escaped from The Leads. \"In profound submission to your majesty\\'s will, \"I remain, \"CASANOVA. \" When I had finished the petition, I made a fair draft of it, and sent it in to the prince, who sent it back to me telling me that he would place it in the empress\\'s hands immediately, but that he would be much obliged by my making a copy for his own use. I did so, and gave both copies to the valet de chambre, and went my way. I trembled like a paralytic, and was afraid that my anger might get me into difficulty. By way of calming myself, I wrote out in the style of a manifesto the narrative I had given to the vile Schrotembach, and which that unworthy magistrate had refused to return to me.',\n",
       " 'He greeted me in a friendly manner and begged me to tell him the story of the girl I had gone to see, on the promise of the Latin quatrain referring to her accommodating disposition. I gave him the address and copied out the verses, and he said that was enough to convince an enlightened judge that I had been slandered; but he, nevertheless, was very doubtful whether justice would be done me. \"What! shall I be obliged to leave Vienna to–morrow?\" \"No, no, the empress cannot possibly refuse you the week\\'s delay. \" \"Why not?\" \"Oh! no one could refuse such an appeal as that. Even the prince could not help smiling as he was reading it in his cold way. After reading it he passed it on to me, and then to the Venetian ambassador, who asked him if he meant to give it to the empress as it stood. \\'This petition,\\' replied the prince, \\'might be sent to God, if one knew the way;\\' and forthwith he ordered one of his secretaries to fold it up and see that it was delivered.',\n",
       " 'We talked of you for the rest of dinner, and I had the pleasure of hearing the Venetian ambassador say that no one could discover any reason for your imprisonment under the Leads. Your duel was also discussed, but on that point we only knew what has appeared in the newspapers. Oblige me by giving me a copy of your petition; that phrase of Schrotembach and the slipper pleased me vastly. \" I copied out the document, and gave it him with a copy of my manifesto. Before he left me the count renewed the invitation to take refuge with him, if I did not hear from the empress before the expiration of the twenty–four hours. At ten o\\'clock I had a visit from the Comte de la Perouse, the Marquis de las Casas, and Signor Uccelli, the secretary of the Venetian embassy. The latter came to ask for a copy of my petition for his chief. I promised he should have it, and I also sent a copy of my manifesto.',\n",
       " \"The only thing which rather interfered with the dignity of this latter piece, and gave it a somewhat comic air, were the four Latin verses, which might make people imagine that, after enjoying the girl as Hebe, I had gone in search of her as Ganymede. This was not the case, but the empress understood Latin and was familiar with mythology, and if she had looked on it in the light I have mentioned I should have been undone. I made six copies of the two documents before I went to bed; I was quite tired out, but the exertion had somewhat soothed me. At noon the next day, young Hasse (son of the chapel–master and of the famous Trustina), secretary of legation to Count Vitzthum, came to tell me from the ambassador that nobody would attack me in my own house, nor in my carriage if I went abroad, but that it would be imprudent to go out on foot. He added that his chief would have the pleasure of calling on me at seven o'clock.\",\n",
       " 'Hasse to let me have all this in writing, and after he had written it out he left me. Thus the order to leave Vienna had been suspended; it must have been done by the sovereign. \"I have no time to lose,\" said I to myself, \"I shall have justice done me, my assassins will be condemned, my purse will be returned with the two hundred ducats in it, and not in the condition in which it was shewn to me by the infamous Schrotembach, who will be punished by dismissal, at least. \" Such were my castles in Spain; who has not built such? \\'Quod nimis miseri volunt hoc facile credunt\\', says Seneca. Before sending my manifesto to the empress, Prince Kaunitz, and to all the ambassadors, I thought it would be well to call on the Countess of Salmor, who spoke to the sovereign early and late. She greeted me by saying that I had better give up wearing my arm in a sling, as it looked as ii I were a charlatan; my arm must be well enough after nine months.',\n",
       " 'I was extremely astonished by this greeting, and replied that if it were not necessary I should not wear a sling, and that I was no charlatan. \"However,\" I added, \"I have come to see you on a different matter. \" \"Yes, I know, but I will have nothing to do with it. \" I gave a turn round and left the room without taking any further notice of her. I returned home feeling overwhelmed by the situation. I had been robbed and insulted by a band of thorough–paced rascals; I could do nothing, justice was denied me, and now I had been made a mock of by a worthless countess. If I had received such an insult from a man I would have soon made him feel the weight of one arm at all events. I could not bear my arm without a sling for an hour; pain and swelling set in immediately. I was not perfectly cured till twenty months after the duel. He said the empress had told Prince Kaunitz that Schrotembach considered my narrative as pure romance.',\n",
       " 'His theory was that I had held a bank at faro with sharpers\\' cards, and had dealt with both hands the arm in the sling being a mere pretence. I had then been taken in the act by one of the gamesters, and my unjust gains had been very properly taken from me. My detector had then handed over my purse, containing forty ducats, to the police, and the money had of course been confiscated. The empress had to choose between believing Schrotembach and dismissing him; and she was not inclined to do the latter, as it would be a difficult matter to find him a successor in his difficult and odious task of keeping Vienna clear of human vermin. But you need not be afraid of any violence, and you can go when you like. \" \"Then I am to be robbed of two hundred ducats with impunity. The empress might at least reimburse me if she does nothing more. Please to ask the prince whether I can ask the sovereign to give me that satisfaction; the least I can demand.',\n",
       " '\" \"If not, I shall leave; for what can I do in a town where I can only drive, and where the Government keeps assassins in its pay?\" \"You are right. The girl who recites Latin verses is well known, but none know her address. I must advise you not to publish your tale as long as you are in Vienna, as it places Schrotembach in a very bad light, and you see the empress has to support him in the exercise of his authority. \" \"I see the force of your argument, and I shall have to devour my anger. I will leave Vienna as soon as the washerwoman sends home my linen, but I will have the story printed in all its black injustice. \" \"The empress is prejudiced against you, I don\\'t know by whom. \" \"I know, though; it is that infernal old hag, Countess Salmor.',\n",
       " '\" The next day I received a letter from Count Vitzthum, in which he said that Prince Kaunitz advised me to forget the two hundred ducats, that the girl and her so–called mother had left Vienna to all appearance, as someone had gone to the address and had failed to find her. I saw that I could do nothing, and resolved to depart in peace, and afterwards to publish the whole story and to hang Pocchini with my own hands when next I met him. About that time a young lady of the Salis de Coire family arrived at Vienna without any companion. The imperial hangman Schrotembach, ordered her to leave Vienna in two days. She replied that she would leave exactly when she felt inclined. The magistrate consigned her to imprisonment in a convent, and she was there still when I left. The emperor went to see her, and the empress, his mother, asked him what he thought of her. His answer was, \"I thought her much more amusing than Schrotembach.',\n",
       " '\" Undoubtedly, every man worthy of the name longs to be free, but who is really free in this world? No one. The philosopher, perchance, may be accounted so, but it is at the cost of too precious sacrifices at the phantom shrine of Liberty. I left the use of my suite of rooms, for which I had paid a month in advance, to Campioni, promising to wait for him at Augsburg, where the Law alone is supreme. I departed alone carrying with me the bitter regret that I had not been able to kill the monster, whose despotism had crushed me. I stopped at Linz on purpose to write to Schrotembach even a more bitter letter than that which I had written to the Duke of Wurtemburg in 1760. I posted it myself, and had it registered so as to be sure of its reaching the scoundrel to whom it had been addressed. It was absolutely necessary for me to write this letter, for rage that has no vent must kill at last.',\n",
       " \"From Linz I had a three days' journey to Munich, where I called on Count Gaetan Zavoicki, who died at Dresden seven years ago. I had known him at Venice when he was in want, and I had happily been useful to him. On my relating the story of the robbery that had been committed on me, he no doubt imagined I was in want, and gave me twenty–five louis. To tell the truth it was much less than what I had given him at Venice, and if he had looked upon his action as paying back a debt we should not have been quits; but as I had never wished him to think that I had lent, not given him money, I received the present gratefully. He also gave me a letter for Count Maximilian Lamberg, marshal at the court of the Prince–Bishop of Augsburg, whose acquaintance I had the honour of having. There was no theatre then in Augsburg, but there were masked balls in which all classes mingled freely. There were also small parties where faro was played for small stakes.\",\n",
       " 'I was tired of the pleasure, the misfortune, and the griefs I had had in three capitals, and I resolved to spend four months in the free city of Augsburg, where strangers have the same privileges as the canons. My purse was slender, but with the economical life I led I had nothing to fear on that score. I was not far from Venice, where a hundred ducats were always at my service if I wanted them. I played a little and waged war against the sharpers who have become more numerous of late than the dupes, as there are also more doctors than patients. I also thought of getting a mistress, for what is life without love? I had tried in vain to retrace Gertrude; the engraver was dead, and no one knew what had become of his daughter. Two or three days before the end of the carnival I went to a hirer of carriages, as I had to go to a ball at some distance from the town. While the horses were being put in, I entered the room to warm my hands, for the weather was very cold.',\n",
       " 'A girl came up and asked me if I would drink a glass of wine. \"No,\" said I; and on the question being repeated, repeated the monosyllable somewhat rudely. The girl stood still and began to laugh, and I was about to turn angrily away when she said,— \"I see you do not remember me?\" I looked at her attentively, and at last I discovered beneath her unusually ugly features the lineaments of Anna Midel, the maid in the engraver\\'s house. I am no longer an object fit for love, but that is your fault. \" \"Mine?\" \"Yes; the four hundred florins you gave me made Count Fugger\\'s coachman marry me, and he not only abandoned me but gave me a disgusting disease, which was like to have been my death. I recovered my health, but I never shall recover my good looks. \" \"I am very sorry to hear all this; but tell me what has become of Gertrude?\" \"Then you don\\'t know that you are going to a ball at her house to– night?\" \"Her house?\" \"Yes.',\n",
       " 'After her father\\'s death she married a well–to–do and respectable man, and I expect you will be pleased with the entertainment. \" \"Is she pretty still?\" \"She is just as she used to be, except that she is six years older and has had children. Gertrude was pleased to see me, and introduced me to her husband as one of her father\\'s old lodgers, and I had altogether a pleasant welcome; but, on sounding her, I found she entertained those virtuous sentiments which might have been expected under the circumstances. Campioni arrived at Augsburg at the beginning of Lent. He was in company with Binetti, who was going to Paris. He had completely despoiled his wife, and had left her for ever. Campioni told me that no one at Vienna doubted my story in the slightest degree. Pocchini and the Sclav had disappeared a few days after my departure, and the Statthalter had incurred a great deal of odium by his treatment of me. Campioni spent a month with me, and then went on to London.',\n",
       " 'I called on Count Lamberg and his countess, who, without being beautiful, was an epitome of feminine charm and amiability. Three months after my arrival, this lady, who was enciente, but did not think her time was due, went with Count Fugger, dean of the chapter, to a party of pleasure at an inn three quarters of a league from Augsburg. I was present; and in the course of the meal she was taken with such violent pains that she feared she would be delivered on the spot. She did not like to tell the noble canon, and thinking that I was more likely to be acquainted with such emergencies she came up to me and told me all. I ordered the coachman to put in his horses instantly, and when the coach was ready I took up the countess and carried her to it. The canon followed us in blank astonishment, and asked me what was the matter. I told him to bid the coachman drive fast and not to spare his horses. \"The countess will be delivered of a child if we do not make haste.',\n",
       " '\" I thought I should be bound to laugh, in spite of my sympathies for the poor lady\\'s pains, when I saw the dean turn green and white and purple, and look as if he were going into a fit, as he realized that the countess might be delivered before his eyes in his own carriage. The bishop was at Plombieres; they would write and tell him! It would be in all the papers! \"Quick! coachman, quick!\" We got to the castle before it was too late. I carried the lady into her rook, and they ran for a surgeon and a midwife. It was no good, however, for in five minutes the count came out and said the countess had just been happily delivered. The dean looked as if a weight had been taken off his mind; however, he took the precaution of having himself blooded. I spent an extremely pleasant four months at Augsburg, supping twice or thrice a week at Count Lamberg\\'s.',\n",
       " 'At these suppers I made the acquaintance of a very remarkable man—Count Thura and Valsamina, then a page in the prince–bishop\\'s household, now Dean of Ratisbon. Algardi, of Bologna, the prince\\'s physician and a delightful man. I often saw at the same house a certain Baron Sellenthin, a Prussian officer, who was always recruiting for his master at Augsburg. He was a pleasant man, somewhat in the Gascon style, soft–spoken, and an expert gamester. Five or six years ago I had a letter from him dated Dresden, in which he said that though he was old, and had married a rich wife, he repented of having married at all. I should say the same if I had ever chanced to marry. During my stay at Augsburg several Poles, who had left their country on account of the troubles, came to see me. Amongst others was Rzewuski, the royal Prothonotary, whom I had known at St. \"What a diet! What plots! What counterplots! What misfortunes!\" said this honest Pole, to me.',\n",
       " '\"Happy are they who have nothing to do with it!\" He was going to Spa, and he assured me that if I followed him I should find Prince Adam\\'s sister, Tomatis, and Madame Catai, who had become the manager\\'s wife. I determined to go to Spa, and to take measures so that I might go there with three or four hundred ducats in my purse. To this intent I wrote to Prince Charles of Courland, who was at Venice, to send me a hundred ducats, and in my letter I gave him an infallible receipt for the philosopher\\'s stone. The letter containing this vast secret was not in cypher, so I advised him to burn it after he had read it, assuring him that I possessed a copy. He did not do so, and it was taken to Paris with his order papers when he was sent to the Bastile. If it had not been for the Revolution my letter would never have seen the light. When the Bastille was destroyed, my letter was found and printed with other curious compositions, which were afterwards translated into German and English.',\n",
       " 'The ignorant fools that abound in the land where my fate wills that I should write down the chief events of my long and troublous life—these fools, I say, who are naturally my sworn foes (for the ass lies not down with the horse), make this letter an article of accusation against me, and think they can stop my mouth by telling me that the letter has been translated into German, and remains to my eternal shame. The ignorant Bohemians are astonished when I tell them that I regard the letter as redounding to my glory, and that if their ears were not quite so long their blame would be turned into praise. I do not know whether my letter has been correctly translated, but since it has become public property I shall set it down here in homage to truth, the only god I adore. I have before me an exact copy of the original written in Augsburg in the year 1767, and we are now in the year 1798.',\n",
       " 'It runs as follows: \"MY LORD,—I hope your highness will either burn this letter after reading it, or else preserve it with the greatest care. It will be better, however, to make a copy in cypher, and to burn the original. My attachment to you is not my only motive in writing; I confess my interest is equally concerned. Allow me to say that I do not wish your highness to esteem me alone for any qualities you may have observed in me; I wish you to become my debtor by the inestimable secret I am going to confide to you. This secret relates to the making of gold, the only thing of which your highness stands in need. If you had been miserly by nature you would be rich now; but you are generous, and will be poor all your days if you do not make use of my secret. \"Your highness told me at Riga that you would like me to give you the secret by which I transmuted iron into copper; I never did so, but now I shall teach you how to make a much more marvellous transmutation.',\n",
       " 'I should point out to you, however, that you are not at present in a suitable place for the operation, although all the materials are easily procurable. The operation necessitates my presence for the construction of a furnace, and for the great care necessary, far the least mistake will spoil all. The transmutation of Mars is an easy and merely mechanical process, but that of gold is philosophical in the highest degree. The gold produced will be equal to that used in the Venetian sequins. You must reflect, my lord, that I am giving you information which will permit you to dispense with me, and you must also reflect that I am confiding to you my life and my liberty. \"The step I am taking should insure your life–long protection, and should raise you above that prejudice which is entertained against the general mass of alchemists. My vanity would be wounded if you refuse to distinguish me from the common herd of operators.',\n",
       " 'All I ask you is that you will wait till we meet before undertaking the process. You cannot do it by yourself, and if you employ any other person but myself, you will betray the secret. I must tell you that, using the same materials, and by the addition of mercury and nitre, I made the tree of projection for the Marchioness d\\'Urfe and the Princess of Anhalt. My fortune would have been made long ago, if I had found a prince with the control of a mint whom I could trust. \"You must take four ounces of good silver, dissolve in aqua fortis, precipitate secundum artem with copper, then wash in lukewarm water to separate the acids; dry, mix with half an ounce of sal ammoniac, and place in a suitable vessel. Afterwards you must take a pound of alum, a pound of Hungary crystals, four ounces of verdigris, four ounces of cinnabar, and two ounces of sulphur. Pulverise and mix, and place in a retort of such size that the above matters will only half fill it.',\n",
       " 'This retort must be placed over a furnace with four draughts, for the heat must be raised to the fourth degree. At first your fire must be slow so as to extract the gross phlegm of the matter, and when the spirit begins to appear, place the receiver under the retort, and Luna with the ammoniac salts will appear in it. All the joinings must be luted with the Philosophical Luting, and as the spirit comes, so regulate your furnace, but do not let it pass the third degree of heat. \"So soon as the sublimation begins then boldly open your forth vent, but take heed that that which is sublimed pass not into the receiver where is your Luna, and so you must shut, the mouth of the retort closely, and keep it so for twenty–four hours, and then take off your fastenings, and allow the distillation to go on. Then you must increase your fire so that the spirits may pass, over, until the matter in the retort is quite desiccated.',\n",
       " 'After this operation has been performed three times, then you shall see, the gold appear in the retort. Then draw it forth and melt it, adding your corpus perfectum. Melt with it two ounces of gold, then lay it in water, and you shall find four ounces of pure gold. \"Such my lord, is the gold mine for your mint of Mitau, by which, with the assistance of a manager and four men, you can assure yourself a revenue of a thousand ducats a week, and double, and quadruple that sum, if your highness chooses to increase the men and the furnaces. But remember it must be a State secret, so burn this letter, and if your highness would give me any reward in advance, I only ask you to give me your affection and esteem. I shall be happy if I have reason to believe that my master will also be my friend. My life, which this letter places in your power, is ever at your service, and I know not what I shall do if I ever have cause to repent having disclosed my secret.',\n",
       " '\" In whatever language this letter may have been translated, if its sense run not as above, it is not my letter, and I am ready to give the lie to all the Mirabeaus in the world. I have been called an exile, but wrongfully, for a man who has to leave a country by virtue of a \\'lettre de cachet\\' is no exile. He is forced to obey a despotic monarch who looks upon his kingdom as his house, and turns out of doors anyone who meets with his displeasure. As soon as my purse swelled to a respectable size, I left Augsburg, The date of my departure was June 14th, 1767. I was at Ulm when a courier of the Duke of Wurtemburg\\'s passed through the town with the news that his highness would arrive from Venice in the course of five or six days. It had been entrusted to him by Prince Charles of Courland, who had told the courier that he would find me at the \"Hotel du Raisin,\" in Augsburg. As it happened, I had left the day before, but knowing the way by which I had gone he caught me up at Ulm.',\n",
       " 'He gave me the letter and asked me if I were the same Casanova who had been placed under arrest and had escaped, on account of some gambling dispute with three officers. As I was never an adept in concealing the truth, I replied in the affirmative. A Wurtemburg officer who was standing beside us observed to me in a friendly manner that he was at Stuttgart at the time, and that most people concurred in blaming the three officers for their conduct in the matter. Without making any reply I read the letter, which referred to our private affairs, but as I was reading it I resolved to tell a little lie—one of those lies which do nobody any harm. \"Well, sir,\" I said to the officer, \"his highness, your sovereign, has listened to reason at last, and this letter informs me of a reparation which is in every way satisfactory. The duke has created me his private secretary, with a salary of twelve hundred a year.',\n",
       " 'God knows what has become of the three officers!\" \"They are all at Louisburg, and― –is now a colonel. \" \"Well, they will be surprised to hear my news, and they will hear it to– morrow, for I am leaving this place in an hour. If they are at Louisburg, I shall have a triumph; but I am sorry not to be able to accompany you, however we shall see each other the day after tomorrow. \" I had an excellent night, and awoke with the beautiful idea of going to Louisburg, not to fight the three officers but to frighten them, triumph over them, and to enjoy a pleasant vengeance for the injury they had done me. I should at the same time see a good many old friends; there was Madame Toscani, the duke\\'s mistress; Baletti, and Vestri, who had married a former mistress of the duke\\'s. I had sounded the depths of the human heart, and knew I had nothing to fear. The duke was on the point of returning, and nobody would dream of impugning the truth of my story.',\n",
       " 'When he actually did arrive he would not find me, for as soon as the courier announced his approach I should go away, telling everybody that I had orders to precede his highness, and everybody would be duped. I was quite proud of it, and I should have despised myself if I had failed to carry it into effect. It would be my vengeance on the duke, who could not have forgotten the terrible letter I had written him; for princes do not forget small injuries as they forget great services. I slept badly the following night, my anxiety was so great, and I reached Louisburg and gave my name at the town gates, without the addition of my pretended office, for my jest must be matured by degrees. I went to stay at the posting–inn, and just as I was asking for the address of Madame Toscani, she and her husband appeared on the scene. They both flung their arms around my neck, and overwhelmed me with compliments on my wounded arm and the victory I had achieved.',\n",
       " '\"What victory?\" \"Your appearance here has filled the hearts of all your friends with joy. \" \"Well, I certainly am in the duke\\'s service, but how did you find it out?\" \"It\\'s the common talk. The courier who gave you the letter has spread it all abroad, and the officer who was present and arrived here yesterday morning confirmed it. But you cannot imagine the consternation of your three foes. However, we are afraid that you will have some trouble with them, as they have kept your letter of defiance given from Furstenberg. \" \"Why didn\\'t they meet me, then?\" \"Two of them could not go, and the third arrived too late. If the duke has no objection I shall be happy to meet them one after another, not three all at once. Of course, the duel must be with pistols; a sword duel is out of the question with my arm in a sling.',\n",
       " 'My daughter wants to make peace before the duke comes, and you had better consent to arrangements, for there are three of them, and it isn\\'t likely that you could kill the whole three one after the other. \" \"You must stop with us this evening; you will see her, for she is no longer the duke\\'s mistress. \" \"If your daughter can bring about an arrangement I would gladly fall in with it, provided it is an honourable one for me. \" \"How is it that you are wearing the sling after all these months?\" \"I am quite cured, and yet my arm swells as soon as I let it swing loose. You shall see it after dinner, for you must dine with me if you want me to sup with you. \" Next came Vestri, whom I did not know, accompanied by my beloved Baletti. With them was an officer who was in love with Madame Toscani\\'s second daughter, and another of their circle, with whom I was also unacquainted. They all came to congratulate me on my honourable position in the duke\\'s service.',\n",
       " 'The reader will recollect that he was my chief assistant in my escape from Stuttgart, and that I was once going to marry his sister. Baletti was a fine fellow, and the duke was very fond of him. He had a little country house, with a spare room, which he begged me to accept, as he said he was only too proud that the duke should know him as my best friend. When his highness came, of course I would have an apartment in the palace. I accepted; and as it was still early, we all went to see the young Toscani. I had loved her in Paris before her beauty had reached its zenith, and she was naturally proud to shew me how beautiful she had become. She shewed me her house and her jewels, told me the story of her amours with the duke, of her breaking with him on account of his perpetual infidelities, and of her marriage with a man she despised, but who was forced on her by her position.',\n",
       " \"At dinner–time we all went to the inn, where we met the offending colonel; he was the first to take off his hat, we returned the salute, and he passed on his way. The dinner was a pleasant one, and when it was over I proceeded to take up my quarters with Baletti. In the evening we went to Madame Toscani's, where I saw two girls of ravishing beauty, Madame Toscani's daughter and Vestri's wife, of whom the duke had had two children. Madame Vestri was a handsome woman, but her wit and the charm of her manner enchanted me still more. There was a certain reserve about the manner of Mdlle. Toscani, so I chiefly addressed myself to Madame Vestri, whose husband was not jealous, for he neither cared for her nor she for him. On the day of my arrival the manager had distributed the parts of a little play which was to be given in honour of the duke's arrival. It had been written by a local author, in hopes of its obtaining the favour of the Court for him.\",\n",
       " 'Madame Vestri played the principal part, which she was prevailed upon to recite. \"Your elocution is admirable, and your expression full of spirit,\" I observed; \"but what a pity it is that you do not pronounce the dentals. \"It makes her acting soft and delicate; other actresses envy her the privilege of what you call a defect. \"I think you are much too sensible to believe such nonsense. \" \"I prefer a man to say honestly, \\'what a pity,\\' than to hear all that foolish flattery. But I am sorry to say that there is no remedy for the defect. \" \"Pardon me, I have an infallible remedy for your complaint. You shall give me a good hearty blow if I do not make you read the part perfectly by to–morrow, but if I succeed in making you read it as your husband, for example\\'s sake, might read it you shall permit me to give you a tender embrace. \" \"Very good; but what must I do?\" \"You must let me weave a spell over your part, that is all.',\n",
       " 'To–morrow morning at nine o\\'clock I will bring it to you to get my blow or my kiss, if your husband has no objection. \" \"You are right, in a general way; but mine will not fail. \" Madame Vestri left me the part, and the conversation turned on other subjects. I was condoled with on my swollen hand, and I told the story of my duel. Everybody seemed to delight in entertaining me and feasting me, and I went back to Baletti\\'s in love with all the ladies, but especially with Madame Vestri and Mdlle. Baletti had a beautiful little girl of three years old. \"There\\'s her mother; and, as a proof of my hospitality, she shall sleep with you to–night. \" \"I accept your generous offer; but let it be to–morrow night. \" \"And why not to–night?\" \"Because I shall be engaged all night in weaving my spell. Do you go to bed, and leave me a light and writing materials. \" I spent six hours in copying out the part, only altering certain phrases. For all words in which the letter r appeared I substituted another.',\n",
       " 'It was a tiresome task, but I longed to embrace Madame Vestri before her husband. I set about my task in the following manner: The text ran: \"Les procedes de cet homme m\\'outragent et me deseparent, je dois penser a me debarrasser. \" For this I substituted: \"Cet homme a des facons qui m\\'offensent et me desolent, il faut que je m\\'en defasse;\" and so on throughout the piece. When I had finished I slept for three hours, and then rose and dressed. Baletti saw my spell, and said I had earned the curses of the young author, as Madame Vestri would no doubt make him write all parts for her without using the letter \\'r\\'; and, indeed, that was just what she did. I gave her the part, and as soon as she saw what I had done she burst out into exclamations of delight; and calling her husband shewed him my contrivance, and said she would never play a part with an \\'r\\' in it again. I promised to copy them all out, and added that I had spent the whole night in amending the present part.',\n",
       " '\"The whole night! Come and take your reward, for you are cleverer than any sorcerer. We must have the author to dinner, and I shall make him promise to write all my parts without the \\'r\\', or the duke will not employ him. Indeed, I don\\'t wonder the duke has made you his secretary. I never thought it would be possible to do what you have done; but I suppose it was very difficult?\" \"Not at all. If I were a pretty woman with the like defect I should take care to avoid all words with an \\'r; in them. \" \"Let us bet again, for a box or a kiss, that you can spend a whole day without using an \\'r\\'. \" \"All in good time,\" said she, \"but we won\\'t have any stake, as I think you are too greedy. \" The author came to dinner, and was duly attacked by Madame Vestri. She began by saying that it was an author\\'s duty to be polite to actresses, and if any of them spoke with a lisp the least he could do was to write their parts without the fatal letter.',\n",
       " 'The young author laughed, and said it could not be done without spoiling the style. Thereupon Madame Vestri gave him my version of her part, telling him to read it, and to say on his conscience whether the style had suffered. He had to confess that my alterations were positive improvements, due to the great richness of the French language. And he was right, for there is no language in the world that can compare in copiousness of expression with the French. This trifling subject kept us merry, but Madame Vestri expressed a devout wish that all authors would do for her what I had done. At Paris, where I heard her playing well and lisping terribly, she did not find the authors so obliging, but she pleased the people. She asked me if I would undertake to recompose Zaire, leaving out the r\\'s. \"Ah!\" said I, \"considering that it would have to be in verse, and in Voltairean verse, I would rather not undertake the task.',\n",
       " '\" With a view to pleasing the actress the young author asked me how I would tell her that she was charming without using an \\'r\\'. \"I should say that she enchanted me, made me in an ecstasy, that she is unique. \" She wrote me a letter, which I still keep, in which the \\'r\\' does not appear. If I could have stayed at Stuttgart, this device of mine might have won me her favours; but after a week of feasting and triumph the courier came one morning at ten o\\'clock and announced that his highness, the duke, would arrive at four. As soon as I heard the news I told Baletti with the utmost coolness that I thought it would be only polite to meet my lord, and swell his train on his entry into Louisburg; and as I wished to meet him at a distance of two stages I should have to go at once. He thought my idea an excellent one, and went to order post–horses immediately; but when he saw me packing up all my belongings into my trunk, he guessed the truth and applauded the jest.',\n",
       " \"He was sorry to lose me, but he laughed when he thought of the feelings of the duke and of the three officers when they found out the trick. He promised to write to me at Mannheim, where I had decided on spending a week to see my beloved Algardi, who was in the service of the Elector. de Sickirigen and Baron Becker, one of the Elector's ministers. When the horses were put in I embraced Baletti, his little girl, and his pretty housekeeper, and ordered the postillion to drive to Mannheim. When we reached Mannheim I heard that the Court was at Schwetzingen, and I bade the postillion drive on. de Sickingen was soliciting the position of ambassador to Paris, and Baron Becker introduced me to the Elector. Five or six days after my arrival died Prince Frederic des Deux Ponts, and I will here relate an anecdote I heard the day before he died. Algardi had attended on the prince during his last illness.\",\n",
       " 'I was supping with Veraci, the poet–laureate, on the eve of the prince\\'s death, and in the course of supper Algardi came in. \"The poor prince—he cannot possibly live more than twenty–four hours. He grieved me to the heart by bidding me tell him the whole truth; he even bade me give my word of honour that I was speaking the truth. Then he asked me if he were positively in danger of death. I told him his sickness was undoubtedly a mortal one, but that with the help of nature and art wonders might be worked. \" \"Then you deceived him, and told a lie?\" \"I did not deceive him; his recovery comes under the category of the possible. I did not want to leave him in despair, for despair would most certainly kill him. \" \"Yes, yes; but you will confess that you told him a lie and broke your word of honour. \" \"I told no lie, for I know that he may possibly be cured. \" \"Then you lied just now?\" \"Not at all, for lie will die to–morrow. \" \"It seems to me that your reasoning is a little Jesuitical.',\n",
       " 'My duty was to prolong my patient\\'s life and to spare him a sentence which would most certainly have shortened it, possibly by several hours; besides, it is not an absolute impossibility that he should recover, therefore I did not lie when I told him that he might recover, nor did I lie just now when I gave it as my opinion (the result of my experience) that he would die to–morrow. I would certainly wager a million to one that he will die to–morrow, but I would not wager my life. \" \"You are right, and yet for all that you deceived the poor man; for his intention in asking you the question was not to be told a commonplace which he knew as well as you, but to learn your true opinion as to his life or death. But again I agree with you that as his physician you were quite right not to shorten his few remaining hours by telling him the terrible truth.',\n",
       " '\" After a fortnight I left Schwetzingen, leaving some of my belongings under the care of Veraci the poet, telling him I would call for them some day; but I never came, and after a lapse of thirty–one years Veraci keeps them still. He affected eccentricity to make himself notorious, and opposed the great Metastasio in everything, writing unwieldy verses which he said gave more scope for the person who set them to music. I traveled to Mayence and thence I sailed to Cologne, where I looked forward to the pleasure of meeting with the burgomaster\\'s wife who disliked General Kettler, and had treated me so well seven years ago. But that was not the only reason which impelled me to visit that odious town. When I was at Dresden I had read in a number of the Cologne Gazette that \"Master Casanova has returned to Warsaw only to be sent about his business again. The king has heard some stories of this famous adventurer, which compel him to forbid him his Court.',\n",
       " '\" I could not stomach language of this kind, and I resolved to pay Jacquet, the editor, a visit, and now my time had come. I made a hasty dinner and then called on the burgomaster, whom I found sitting at table with his fair Mimi. They welcomed me warmly, and for two hours I told them the story of my adventures during the last seven years. Mimi had to go out, and I was asked to dine with them the next day. I thought she looked prettier than ever, and my imagination promised me some delicious moments with her. I spent an anxious and impatient night, and called on my Amphitryon at an early hour to have an opportunity of speaking to his dear companion. I found her alone, and began with an ardent caress which she gently repelled, but her face froze my passion in its course. \"Time is an excellent doctor,\" said she, \"and it has cured me of a passion which left behind it the sting of remorse.',\n",
       " '\" \"Should only serve as a place wherein to confess our sins of the past, and to implore grace to sin no more. \" \"May the Lord save me from repentance, the only source of which is a prejudice! I shall leave Cologne to–morrow. \" She was delightful at table, but I was gloomy and distracted. At seven o\\'clock next day I set out, and as soon as I had passed the Aix la Chapelle Gate, I told the postillion to stop and wait for me. I then walked to Jacquet\\'s, armed with a pistol and a cane, though I only meant to beat him. The servant shewed me into the room where he was working by himself. It was on the ground floor, and the door was open for coolness\\' sake. He heard me coming in and asked what he could do for me. \" I replied, \"I am the adventurer Casanova whom you slandered in your miserable sheet four months ago. \" So saying I directed my pistol at his head, with my left hand, and lifted my cane with my right.',\n",
       " 'But the wretched scribbler fell on his knees before me with clasped hands and offered to shew me the signed letter he had received from Warsaw, which contained the statements he had inserted in his paper. \"Where is this letter?\" \"You shall have it in a moment. \" I made way for him to search, but I locked and bolted the door to prevent his escaping. The man trembled like a leaf and began to look for the letter amongst his Warsaw correspondence, which was in a disgraceful state of confusion. I shewed him the date of the article in the paper, but the letter could not be found; and at the end of an hour he fell down again on his knees, and told me to do what I would to him. I gave him a kick and told him to get up and follow me. He made no reply, and followed me bareheaded till he saw me get into my chaise and drive off, and I have no doubt he gave thanks to God for his light escape.',\n",
       " 'In the evening, I reached Aix–la–Chapelle, where I found Princess Lubomirska, General Roniker, several other distinguished Poles, Tomatis and his wife, and many Englishmen of my acquaintance.',\n",
       " 'Chapter II My Stay at Spa--the Blow--the Sword--della Croce--charlotte; Her Lying- in and Death--a Lettre De Cachet Obliges Me to Leave Paris in the Course of Twenty-four Hours All my friends seemed delighted to see me, and I was well pleased to find myself in such good company. Nearly everyone went, and those who stayed only did so because lodgings were not to be had at Spa. Everybody assured me that this was the case, and many had returned after seeking in vain for a mere garret. I paid no attention to all this, and told the princess that if she would come with me I would find some lodging, were it only in my carriage. We accordingly set out the next day, and got to Spa in good time, our company consisting of the princess, the prothonotary, Roniker, and the Tomatis. Everyone except myself had taken rooms in advance, I alone knew not where to turn. I got out and prepared for the search, but before going along the streets I went into a shop and bought a hat, having lost mine on the way.',\n",
       " 'I explained my situation to the shopwoman, who seemed to take an interest in me, and began speaking to her husband in Flemish or Walloon, and finally informed me that if it were only for a few days she and her husband would sleep in the shop and give up their room to me. But she said that she had absolutely no room whatever for my man. \" \"Where shall I send it?\" \"I will see that it is housed safely. \" \"How much am I to pay?\" \"Nothing; and if you are not too particular, we should like you to share our meals. \" I went up a narrow staircase, and found myself in a pretty little room with a closet, a good bed, suitable furniture, and everything perfectly neat and clean. I thought myself very lucky, and asked the good people why they would not sleep in the closet rather than the shop, and they replied with one breath that they would be in my way, while their niece would not interfere with me.',\n",
       " 'The closet had no door, and was not much bigger than the bed which it contained; it was, in fact, a mere alcove, without any window. I must note that my hostess and her husband, both of them from Liege, were perfect models of ugliness. \"It\\'s not within the limits of possibility,\" I said to myself, \"for the niece to be uglier than they, but if they allow her to sleep thus in the same room with the first comer, she must be proof against all temptation. \" However, I gave no sign, and did not ask to see the niece for fear of offense, and I went out without opening my trunk. I told them as I went out that I should not be back till after supper, and gave them some money to buy wax candles and night lights. All the company congratulated me on my good fortune in finding a lodging. I went to the concert, to the bank at faro, and to the other gaming saloons, and there I saw the so–called Marquis d\\'Aragon, who was playing at piquet with an old count of the Holy Roman Empire.',\n",
       " \"I was told about the duel he had had three weeks before with a Frenchman who had picked a quarrel with him; the Frenchman had been wounded in the chest, and was still ill. Nevertheless, he was only waiting for his cure to be completed to have his revenge, which he had demanded as he was taken off the field. Such is the way of the French when a duel is fought for a trifling matter. They stop at the first blood, and fight the duel over and over again. In Italy, on the other hand, duels are fought to the death. Our blood burns to fire when our adversary's sword opens a vein. Thus stabbing is common in Italy and rare in France; while duels are common in France, and rare in Italy. Of all the company at Spa, I was most pleased to see the Marquis Caraccioli, whom I had left in London. His Court had given him leave of absence, and he was spending it at Spa.\",\n",
       " \"He was brimful of wit and the milk of human kindness, compassionate for the weaknesses of others, and devoted to youth, no matter of what sex, but he knew well the virtue of moderation, and used all things without abusing them. He never played, but he loved a good gamester and despised all dupes. The worthy marquis was the means of making the fortune of the so–called Marquis d'Aragon by becoming surety for his nobility and bona fides to a wealthy English widow of fifty, who had taken a fancy to him, and brought him her fortune of sixty thousand pounds sterling. No doubt the widow was taken with the gigantic form and the beautiful title of d'Aragon, for Dragon (as his name really was) was devoid of wit and manners, and his legs, which I suppose he kept well covered, bore disgusting marks of the libertine life he had led. I saw the marquis some time afterwards at Marseilles, and a few years later he purchased two estates at Modena.\",\n",
       " 'His wife died in due course, and according to the English law he inherited the whole of her property. I returned to my lodging in good time, and went to bed without seeing the niece, who was fast asleep. I was waited on by the ugly aunt, who begged me not to take a servant while I remained in her house, for by her account all servants were thieves. When I awoke in the morning the niece had got up and gone down. I dressed to go to the Wells, and warned my host and hostess that I should have the pleasure of dining with them. The room I occupied was the only place in which they could take their meals, and I was astonished when they came and asked my permission to do so. The niece had gone out, so I had to put my curiosity aside. When I was out my acquaintances pointed out to me the chief beauties who then haunted the Wells.',\n",
       " 'The number of adventurers who flock to Spa during the season is something incredible, and they all hope to make their fortunes; and, as may be supposed, most of them go away as naked as they came, if not more so. Money circulates with great freedom, but principally amongst the gamesters, shop–keepers, money–lenders, and courtezans. The money which proceeds from the gaming– table has three issues: the first and smallest share goes to the Prince– Bishop of Liege; the second and larger portion, to the numerous amateur cheats who frequent the place; and by far the largest of all to the coffers of twelve sharpers, who keep the tables and are authorized by the sovereign. It comes from the pockets of the dupes—poor moths who burn their wings at Spa! The Wells are a mere pretext for gaming, intriguing, and fortune– hunting. There are a few honest people who go for amusement, and a few for rest and relaxation after the toils of business.',\n",
       " \"The table d'hote is excellent, and only costs a small French crown, and one can get good lodging for the like sum. I went into the shop, intending to go to my room, but I was stopped short by seeing a handsome brunette, of nineteen or twenty, with great black eyes, voluptuous lips, and shining teeth, measuring out ribbon on the counter. This, then, was the niece, whom I had imagined as so ugly. I concealed my surprise and sat down in the shop to gaze at her and endeavour to make her acquaintance. But she hardly seemed to see me, and only acknowledged my presence by a slight inclination of the head. Her aunt came down to say that dinner was ready, and I went upstairs and found the table laid for four. The servant brought in the soup, and then asked me very plainly to give her some money if I wanted any wine, as her master and mistress only drank beer. I was delighted with her freedom, and gave her money to buy two bottles of Burgundy.\",\n",
       " 'The master came up and shewed me a gold repeater with a chain also of gold by a well–known modern maker. \" \"A gentleman wants me to give him twenty louis for it, on the condition that I return it to–morrow if he brings me twenty–two. \" I gave him the twenty Louis, and placed the watch in my jewel–casket. At table the niece sat opposite to me, but I took care not to look at her, and she, like a modest girl, did not say a score of words all through the meal. The meal was an excellent one, consisting of soup, boiled beef, an entree, and a roast. The mistress of the house told me that the roast was in my honour, \"for,\" she said, \"we are not rich people, and we only allow ourselves this Luxury on a Sunday. \" I admired her delicacy, and the evident sincerity with which she spoke. I begged my entertainers to help me with my wine, and they accepted the offer, saying they only wished they were rich enough to be able to drink half a bottle a day.',\n",
       " '\" \"The stuff is not ours, and we have debts; besides, the expenses are very great. \" \"Do you only sell hats?\" \"No, we have silk handkerchiefs, Paris stockings, and lace ruffs, but they say everything is too dear. \" \"I will buy some things for you, and will send all my friends here. \" \"Mercy, fetch down one or two packets of those handkerchiefs and some stockings, large size, for the gentleman has a big leg. I pronounced the handkerchiefs superb and the stockings excellent. I bought a dozen, and I promised them that they should sell out their whole stock. They overwhelmed me with thanks, and promised to put themselves entirely in my hands. After coffee, which, like the roast, was in my honour, the aunt told her niece to take care to awake me in the morning when she got up. She said she would not fail, but I begged her not to take too much trouble over me, as I was a very heavy sleeper.',\n",
       " 'In the afternoon I went to an armourer\\'s to buy a brace of pistols, and asked the man if he knew the tradesman with whom I was staying. \" \"Why?\" \"Because he is unfortunate, like most honest people. \" \"How about his wife?\" \"Her careful economy keeps him above water. \" \"Do you know the niece?\" \"Yes; she\\'s a good girl, but very pious. Her silly scruples keep customers away from the shop. \" \"What do you think she should do to attract customers?\" \"She should be more polite, and not play the prude when anyone wants to give her a kiss. \" \"She is like that, is she?\" \"Try her yourself and you will see. My cousin scolded her, and she wanted to go back to Liege; however, the wife soothed her again. She is pretty enough, don\\'t you think so?\" \"Certainly I do, but if she is as cross–grained as you say, the best thing will be to leave her alone.',\n",
       " '\" After what I had heard I made up my mind to change my room, for Mercy had pleased me in such a way that I was sure I should be obliged to pay her a call before long, and I detested Pamelas as heartily as Charpillons. In the afternoon I took Rzewuski and Roniker to the shop, and they bought fifty ducats\\' worth of goods to oblige me. The next day the princess and Madame Tomatis bought all the handkerchiefs. I came home at ten o\\'clock, and found Mercy in bed as I had done the night before. Next morning the watch was redeemed, and the hatter returned me twenty–two louis. I made him a present of the two louis, and said I should always be glad to lend him money in that way—the profits to be his. I was asked to dine with Madame Tomatis, so I told my hosts that I would have the pleasure of supping with them, the costs to be borne by me. The supper was good and the Burgundy excellent, but Mercy refused to taste it.',\n",
       " 'She happened to leave the room for a moment at the close of the meal, and I observed to the aunt that her niece was charming, but it was a pity she was so sad. \"She will have to change her ways, or I will keep her no longer. \" \"I wonder she can sleep so comfortably with a man at a few feet distant. \" Mercy came in, bade us good night, and said she would go to bed. I made as if I would give her a kiss, but she turned her back on me, and placed a chair in front of her closet so that I might not see her taking off her chemise. My host and hostess then went to bed, and so did I, puzzling my head over the girl\\'s behaviour which struck me as most extraordinary and unaccountable. However, I slept peacefully, and when I awoke the bird had left the nest. I felt inclined to have a little quiet argument with the girl, and to see what I could make of her; but I saw no chance of my getting an opportunity.',\n",
       " 'The hatter availed himself of my offer of purse to lend money on pledges, whereby he made a good profit. There was no risk for me in the matter, and he and his wife declared that they blessed the day on which I had come to live with them. On the fifth or sixth day I awoke before Mercy, and only putting on my dressing–gown I came towards her bed. She had a quick ear and woke up, and no sooner did she see me coming towards her than she asked me what I wanted. I sat down on her bed and said gently that I only wanted to wish her a good day and to have a little talk. It was hot weather, and she was only covered by a single sheet; and stretching out one arm I drew her towards me, and begged her to let me give her a kiss.',\n",
       " 'Her resistance made me angry; and passing an audacious hand under the sheet I discovered that she was made like other women; but just as my hand was on the spot, I received a fisticuff on the nose that made me see a thousand stars, and quite extinguished the fire of my concupiscence. The blood streamed from my nose and stained the bed of the furious Mercy. I kept my presence of mind and left her on the spot, as the blow she had given me was but a sample of what I might expect if I attempted reprisals. I washed my face in cold water, and as I was doing so Mercy dressed herself and left the room. At last my blood ceased to flow, and I saw to my great annoyance that my nose was swollen in such a manner that my face was simply hideous. I covered it up with a handkerchief and sent for the hairdresser to do my hair, and when this was done my landlady brought me up some fine trout, of which I approved; but as I was giving her the money she saw my face and uttered a cry of horror.',\n",
       " 'I told her the whole story, freely acknowledging that I was in the wrong, and begging her to say nothing to her niece. Then heeding not her excuses I went out with my handkerchief before my face, and visited a house which the Duchess of Richmond had left the day before. Half of the suite she had abandoned had been taken in advance by an Italian marquis; I took the other half, hired a servant, and had my effects transported there from my old lodgings. The tears and supplications of my landlady had no effect whatever upon me, I felt I could not bear the sight of Mercy any longer. In the house into which I had moved I found an Englishman who said he would bring down the bruise in one hour, and make the discoloration of the flesh disappear in twenty–four. He rubbed the place with spirits of wine and some drug which is unknown to me; but being ashamed to appear in public in the state I was in, I kept indoors for the rest of the day.',\n",
       " 'At noon the distressed aunt brought me my trout, and said that Mercy was cut to the heart to have used me so, and that if I would come back I could do what I liked with her. \"You must feel,\" I replied, \"that if I complied with your request the adventure would become public to the damage of my honour and your business, and your niece would not be able to pass for a devotee any longer. \" I made some reflections on the blow she had given the officer, much to the aunt\\'s surprise, for she could not think how I had heard of it; and I shewed her that, after having exposed me to her niece\\'s brutality, her request was extremely out of place. I concluded by saying that I could believe her to be an accomplice in the fact without any great stretch of imagination. This made her burst into tears, and I had to apologize and to promise to continue forwarding her business by way of consolation, and so she left me in a calmer mood.',\n",
       " 'Half an hour afterwards her husband came with twenty–five Louis I had lent him on a gold snuff–box set with diamonds, and proposed that I should lend two hundred Louis on a ring worth four hundred. \"It will be yours,\" he said, \"if the owner does not bring me two hundred and twenty Louis in a week\\'s time. \" I had the money and proceeded to examine the stone which seemed to be a good diamond, and would probably weigh six carats as the owner declared. \"I consent to give the sum required if the owner is ready to give me a receipt. \" \"I will do so myself in the presence of witnesses. You shall have the money in the course of an hour; I am going to have the stone taken out first. That will make no difference to the owner, as I shall have it reset at my own expense. \" \"I must ask him whether he has any objection to the stone being taken out. \" \"Very good, but you can tell him that if he will not allow it to be done he will get nothing for it.',\n",
       " '\" He returned before long with a jeweller who said he would guarantee the stone to be at least two grains over the six carats. \"Have you weighed it?\" \"No, but I am quite sure it weighs over six carats. \" \"Then you can lend the money on it?\" \"I cannot command such a sum. \" \"Can you tell me why the owner objects to the stone being taken out and put in at my expense?\" \"No, I can\\'t; but he does object. \" They went away, leaving me well pleased at my refusal, for it was plain that the stone was either false or had a false bottom. I spent the rest of the day in writing letters and making a good supper, In the morning I was awoke by someone knocking at my door, and on my getting up to open it, what was my astonishment to find Mercy! I let her in, and went back to bed, and asked her what she wanted with me so early in the morning. She sat down on the bed, and began to overwhelm me with apologies.',\n",
       " 'I replied by asking her why, if it was her principle to fly at her lovers like a tiger, she had slept almost in the same room as myself. \"In sleeping in the closet,\" said she, \"I obeyed my aunt\\'s orders, and in striking you (for which I am very sorry) I was but defending my honour; and I cannot admit that every man who sees me is at liberty to lose his reason. I think you will allow that your duty is to respect, and mine to defend, my honour. \" \"If that is your line of argument, I acknowledge that you are right; but you had nothing to complain of, for I bore your blow in silence, and by my leaving the house you might know that it was my intention to respect you for the future. Did you come to hear me say this? If so, you are satisfied. But you will not be offended if I laugh at your excuses, for after what you have said I cannot help thinking them very laughable. \" \"What have I said?\" \"That you only did your duty in flattening my nose.',\n",
       " 'If so, do you think it is necessary to apologize for the performance of duty?\" \"I ought to have defended myself more gently. But forget everything and forgive me; I will defend myself no more in any way. I am yours and I love you, and I am ready to prove my love. \" She could not have spoken more plainly, and as she spoke the last words she fell on me with her face close to mine, which she bedewed with her tears. I was ashamed of such an easy conquest, and I gently withdrew from her embrace, telling her to return after the bruise on my face had disappeared. The Italian, who had taken half the suite of rooms, had arrived in the course of the night. I asked his name, and was given a card bearing the name of The Marquis Don Antonio della Croce. I asked what kind of an establishment he had, and was informed that the marchioness had a lady\\'s maid, and the marquis a secretary and two servants.',\n",
       " 'I had not long to wait, for as soon as he heard that I was his neighbour, he came to see me, and we spent two hours in telling each other our adventures since we had parted in Milan. He had heard that I had made the fortune of the girl he had abandoned, and in the six years that had elapsed he had been travelling all over Europe, engaged in a constant strife with fortune. At Paris and Brussels he had made a good deal of money, and in the latter town he had fallen in love with a young lady of rank, whom her father had shut up in a convent. He had taken her away, and she it was whom he called the Marchioness della Croce, now six months with child. He made her pass for his wife, because, as he said, he meant to marry her eventually. \"I have fifty thousand francs in gold,\" said he, \"and as much again in jewellery and various possessions. It is my intention to give suppers here and hold a bank, but if I play without correcting the freaks of fortune I am sure to lose.',\n",
       " '\" He intended going to Warsaw, thinking I would give him introductions to all my friends there; but he made a mistake, and I did not even introduce him to my Polish friends at Spa. I told him he could easily make their acquaintance by himself, and that I would neither make nor mar with him. I accepted his invitation to dinner for the same day. His secretary, as he called him, was merely his confederate. He was a clever Veronese named Conti, and his wife was an essential accomplice in Croce\\'s designs. At noon my friend the hatter came again with the ring, followed by the owner, who looked like a bravo. They were accompanied by the jeweller and another individual. The owner asked me once more to lend him two hundred louis on the ring. My proper course would have been to beg to be excused, then I should have had no more trouble in the matter; but it was not to be.',\n",
       " 'I wanted to make him see that the objection he made to having the stone taken out was an insuperable obstacle to my lending him the money. \"When the stone is removed,\" said I, \"we shall see what it really is. Listen to my proposal: if it weighs twenty–six grains, I will give you, not two but three hundred louis, but in its present condition I shall give nothing at all. \" \"You have no business to doubt my word; you insult me by doing so. If the stone be found to weigh twenty–six grains, I shall lose two hundred Louis, if it weighs much less you will lose the ring. \" \"That\\'s a scandalous proposal; it\\'s as much as to tell me that I am a liar. \" I did not like the tone with which these words were spoken, and I went up to the chest of drawers where I kept my pistols, and bade him go and leave me in peace. Just then General Roniker came in, and the owner of the ring told him of the dispute between us.',\n",
       " 'The general looked at the ring, and said to him,— \"If anyone were to give me the ring I should not have the stone taken out, because one should not look a gift horse in the mouth; but if it came to a question of buying or lending I would not give a crown for it, were the owner an emperor, before the stone was taken out; and I am very much surprised at your refusing to let this be done. \" Without a word the knave made for the door, and the ring remained in the hands of my late host. \"Because I have advanced him fifty Louis on it; but if he does not redeem it to–morrow I will have the stone taken out before a judge, and afterwards I shall sell it by auction. \" \"I don\\'t like the man\\'s manners, and I hope you will never bring anyone to my rooms again. \" The affair came to the following conclusion: The impostor did not redeem the ring, and the Liege tradesman had the setting removed. The diamond was found to be placed on a bed of rock crystal, which formed two–thirds of the whole bulk.',\n",
       " 'However, the diamond was worth fifty Louis, and an Englishman bought it. A week afterwards the knave met me as I was walking by myself, and begged me to follow him to place where we should be free from observation, as his sword had somewhat to say to mine. Curiously enough I happened to be wearing my sword at the time. \"I will not follow you,\" I replied; \"the matter can be settled here?\" \"We are observed. If you do not draw I will proclaim you to be the coward I am sure you are. \" At this he drew his sword rapidly and came on, but I was ready to receive him. He began to fence to try my mettle, but I lunged right at his chest, and gave him three inches of cold steel. I should have killed him on the spot if he had not lowered his sword, saying he would take his revenge at another time. With this he went off, holding his hand to the wound. A score of people were close by, but no one troubled himself about the wounded man, as he was known to have been the aggressor.',\n",
       " \"When I left Spa the man was still in the surgeon's hands. He was something worse than an adventurer, and all the French at Spa disowned him. The marchioness, his wife so–called, was a young lady of sixteen or seventeen, fair–complexioned and tall, with all the manners of the Belgian nobility. The history of her escape is well known to her brothers and sisters, and as her family are still in existence my readers will be obliged to me for concealing her name. Her husband had told her about me, and she received me in the most gracious manner possible. She shewed no signs of sadness or of repentance for the steps she had taken. She was with child for some months, and seemed to be near her term, owing to the slimness of her figure. Her countenance expressed candour and frankness of disposition in a remarkable degree. Her eyes were large and blue, her complexion a roseate hue, her small sweet mouth, her perfect teeth made her a beauty worthy of the brush of Albano.\",\n",
       " \"I thought myself skilled in physiognomy, and concluded that she was not only perfectly happy, but also the cause of happiness. But here let me say how vain a thing it is for anyone to pronounce a man or woman to be happy or unhappy from a merely cursory inspection. The young marchioness had beautiful ear–rings, and two rings, which gave me a pretext for admiring the beauty of her hands. Conti's wife did not cut any figure at all, and I was all eyes for the marchioness, whose name was Charlotte. I was profoundly impressed by her that I was quite abstracted during dinner. I sought in vain to discover by what merits Croce had been able to seduce two such superior women. He was not a fine–looking man, he was not well educated, his manners were doubtful, and his way of speaking by no means seductive; in fine, I saw nothing captivating about him, and yet I could be a witness to his having made two girls leave their homes to follow him.\",\n",
       " 'I lost myself in conjecture; but I had no premonition of what was to happen in the course of a few weeks. When dinner was over I took Croce apart, and talked seriously to him. I impressed on him the necessity of circumspect conduct, as in my opinion he would be for ever infamous if the beautiful woman whom he had seduced was to become wretched by his fault. \"For the future I mean to trust to my skill in play, and thus I am sure of a comfortable living. \" \"Does she know, that your revenue is fed solely by the purses of dupes?\" \"She knows that I am a gamester; and as she adores me, her will is as mine. I am thinking of marrying her at Warsaw before she is confined. If you are in any want of money, look upon my purse as your own. \" I thanked him, and once more pressed on him the duty of exercising extreme prudence. I had played with moderation, and my profits amounted to nearly four hundred louis. When the luck turned against me I was wise enough to turn my back on the board.',\n",
       " \"Although the bruise that Mercy had given me was still apparent, I escorted the marchioness to the tables, and there she drew all eyes upon her. She was fond of piquet, and we played together for small stakes for some time. In the end she lost twenty crowns to me, and I was forced to take the money for fear of offending her. When we went back we met Croce and Conti, who had both won—Conti a score of louis at Faro, and Croce more than a hundred guineas at 'passe dix', which he had been playing at a club of Englishmen. I was more lively at supper than dinner, and excited Charlotte to laughter by my wit. Henceforth the Poles and the Tomatis only saw me at intervals. I was in love with the fair marchioness, and everybody said it was very natural. When a week had elapsed, Croce, finding that the pigeons would not come to be plucked, despite the suppers he gave, went to the public room, and lost continually.\",\n",
       " \"He was as used to loss as to gain, and his spirits were unaltered; he was still gay, still ate well and drank better, and caressed his victim, who had no suspicions of what was going on. I loved her, but did not dare to reveal my passion, fearing lest it should be unrequited; and I was afraid to tell her of Croce's losses lest she should put down my action to some ulterior motive; in fine, I was afraid to lose the trust she had already begun to place in me. At the end of three weeks Conti, who had played with prudence and success, left Croce and set out for Verona with his wife and servant. A few days later Charlotte dismissed her maid, sending her back to Liege, her native town. Towards the middle of September all the Polish party left the Spa for Paris, where I promised to rejoin them. I only stayed for Charlotte's sake; I foresaw a catastrophe, and I would not abandon her. Every day Croce lost heavily, and at last he was obliged to sell his jewellery.\",\n",
       " 'Then came Charlotte\\'s turn; she had to give up her watches, ear–rings, her rings, and all the jewels she had. He lost everything, but this wonderful girl was as affectionate as ever. To make a finish he despoiled her of her lace and her best gowns, and then selling his own wardrobe he went to his last fight with fortune, provided with two hundred Louis. He played like a madman, without common–sense or prudence, and lost all. His pockets were empty, and seeing me he beckoned to me, and I followed him out of the Spa. \"My friend,\" he began, \"I have two alternatives, I can kill myself this instant or I can fly without returning to the house. I shall embrace the latter and go to Warsaw on foot, and I leave my wife in your hands, for I know you adore her. It must be your task to give her the dreadful news of the pass to which I have come. Have a care of her, she is too good by far for a poor wretch like me. Take her to Paris and I will write to you there at your brother\\'s address.',\n",
       " 'I know you have money, but I would die rather than accept a single louis from you. I have still two or three pieces left, and I assure you that I am richer at the present moment than I was two months ago. Farewell; once more I commend Charlotte to your care; I would that she had never known me. \" With these words he shed tears, and embracing me went his way. I had to inform a pregnant woman that the man she dearly loved had deserted her. The only thought that supported me in that moment was that it would be done for love of her, and I felt thankful that I had sufficient means to secure her from privation. I went to the house and told her that we might dine at once, as the marquis would be engaged till the evening. She sighed, wished him luck, and we proceeded to dine. I disguised my emotions so well that she conceived no suspicion. After the meal was over, I asked her to walk with me in the garden of the Capuchin Monastery, which was close at hand.',\n",
       " 'To prepare her for the fatal news I asked her if she would approve of her lover exposing himself to assassination for the sake of bidding adieu to her rather than making his escape. \"He ought to escape by all means, if only to save his life for my sake. My spirit is strong enough to resist even so fatal a blow, for I know I have a friend in you. But first of all remember this; you must look upon me as a tender father who will never let you want, so long as life remains to him. \" \"In that case I cannot be called unfortunate, for I have a true friend. \" I told all that Croce had told me, not omitting his last words: \"I commend Charlotte to your care; I would that she had never known me. \" For a few minutes she remained motionless, as one turned into stone. By her attitude, by her laboured and unequal breath, I could divine somewhat of the battle between love, and anger, and sorrow, and pity, that was raging in the noble breast.',\n",
       " 'At last she wiped away the big tears that began to trickle down her cheeks, and turning to me sighed and said,— \"Dear friend, since I can count on you, I am far indeed from utter misery. \" \"I swear to you, Charlotte, that I will never leave you till I place you again in your husband\\'s hands, provided I do not die before. I swear eternal gratitude, and to be as submissive to you as a good daughter ought to be. \" The religion and philosophy with which her heart and mind were fortified, though she made no parade of either, began to calm her spirit, and she proceeded to make some reflections on Croce\\'s unhappy lot, but all in pity not in anger, excusing his inveterate passion for play. She had often heard from Croce\\'s lips the story of the Marseilles girl whom he had left penniless in an inn at Milan, commending her to my care. She thought it something wonderful that I should again be intervening as the tutelary genius; but her situation was much the worse, for she was with child.',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s another difference,\" I added, \"for I made the fortune of the first by finding her an honest husband, whereas I should never have the courage to adopt the same method with the second. \" \"While Croce lives I am no man\\'s wife but his, nevertheless I am glad to find myself free. \" When we were back in the house, I advised her to send away the servant and to pay his journey to Besanion, where she had taken him. I made her sell all that remained of her poor lover\\'s wardrobe, as also his carriage, for mine was a better one. She shewed me all she had left, which only amounted to some sets of linen and three or four dresses. She could see that my love was a tenderer passion than the love of a father, and she told me so, and that she was obliged to me for the respect with which I treated her. We sat together for hours, she folded in my arms, whilst I gently kissed her beautiful eyes, and asked no more. I was happy in her gratitude and in my powers of self–restraint.',\n",
       " \"When temptation was too strong I left the beautiful girl till I was myself again, and such conquests made me proud. In the affection between us there was somewhat of the purity of a man's first love. I wanted a small travelling cap, and the servant of the house went to my former lodging to order one. She blushed when she saw me, but I said nothing to her. When she had gone I told Charlotte the whole story, and she laughed with all her heart when I reminded her of the bruise on my face when we first met, and informed her that Mercy had given it me. She praised my firmness in rejecting her repentance, and agreed with me in thinking that the whole plan had been concerted between her and her aunt. We left Spa without any servant, and when we reached Liege we took the way of the Ardennes, as she was afraid of being recognized if we passed through Brussels. At Luxemburg we engaged a servant, who attended on us till we reached Paris.\",\n",
       " 'All the way Charlotte was tender and affectionate, but her condition prescribed limits to her love, and I could only look forward to the time after her delivery. We got down at Paris at the \"Hotel Montmorenci,\" in the street of the same name. Madame d\\'Urfe was dead, my friends had changed their houses and their fortunes; the poor had become rich and the rich poor, new streets and buildings were rising on all sides; I hardly knew my way about the town. Everything was dearer; poverty was rampant, and luxury at it highest pitch. Perhaps Paris is the only city where so great a change could take place in the course of five or six years. The first call I made was on Madame du Rumain, who was delighted to see me. I repaid her the money she had so kindly lent me in the time of my distress. She was well in health, but harassed by so many anxieties and private troubles that she said Providence must have sent me to her to relieve her of all her griefs by my cabala.',\n",
       " \"I told her that I would wait on her at any hour or hours; and this, indeed, was the least I could do for the woman who had been so kind to me. Both he and his wife (who remained constant to him, despite his physical disability) were overjoyed to see me, and entreated me to come and stop with them. I told them I should be glad to do so, as soon as the lady who had travelled with me had got over her confinement. I did not think proper to tell them her story, and they had the delicacy to refrain from questioning me on the subject. The same day I called on Princess Lubomirska and Tomatis, begging them not to take it amiss if my visits were few and far between, as the lady they had seen at Spa was approaching her confinement, and demanded all my care. After the discharge of these duties I remained constantly by Charlotte's side. On October 8th I thought it would be well to take her to Madame Lamarre, a midwife, who lived in the Faubourg St.\",\n",
       " 'We went together, she saw the room, the bed, and heard how she would be tended and looked after, for all of which I would pay. At nightfall we drove to the place, with a trunk containing all her effects. As we were leaving the Rue Montmorenci our carriage was obliged to stop to allow the funeral of some rich man to go by. Charlotte covered her face with her handkerchief, and whispered in my ear, \"Dearest, I know it is a foolish superstition, but to a woman in my condition such a meeting is of evil omen. \" \"What, Charlotte! I thought you were too wise to have such silly fears. A woman in child–bed is not a sick woman, and no woman ever died of giving birth to a child except some other disease intervened. \" \"Yes, my dear philosopher, it is like a duel; there are two men in perfect health, when all of a sudden there comes a sword–thrust, and one of them is dead.',\n",
       " 'But bid all gloomy thoughts go by, and after your child is born, and we have placed it in good hands, you shall come with me to Madrid, and there I hope to see you happy and contented. \" All the way I did my best to cheer her, for I knew only too well the fatal effects of melancholy on a pregnant woman, especially in such a delicate girl as Charlotte. When I saw her completely settled I returned to the hotel, and the next day I took up my quarters with my brother. However, as long as my Charlotte lived, I only slept at his house, for from nine in the morning till after midnight I was with my dear. On October 13th Charlotte was attacked with a fever which never left her. On the 17th she was happily delivered of a boy, which was immediately taken to the church and baptized at the express wishes of the mother. Charlotte wrote down what its name was to be—Jacques (after me), Charles (after her), son of Antonio della Croce and of Charlotte de (she gave her real name).',\n",
       " 'When it was brought from the church she told Madame Lamarre to carry it to the Foundling Hospital, with the certificate of baptism in its linen. I vainly endeavoured to persuade her to leave the care of the child to me. She said that if it lived the father could easily reclaim it. On the same day, October 18th, the midwife gave me the following certificate, which I still possess: It was worded as follows: \"We, J. Dorival, Councillor to the King, Commissary of the Chatelet, formerly Superintendent of Police in the City of Paris, do certify that there has been taken to the Hospital for Children a male infant, appearing to be one day old, brought from the Faubourg St. Denis by the midwife Lamarre, and bearing a certificate of baptism to the effect that its name is Jacques Charles, son of Antonio della Croce and of Charlotte de―.',\n",
       " 'Wherefore, we have delivered the above certificate at our office in the City of Paris, this 18th day of October, in the year of our Lord, 1767, at seven o\\'clock in the afternoon. \" If any of my readers have any curiosity to know the real name of the mother, I have given them the means of satisfying it. After this I did not leave the bed of the invalid for a single instant. In spite of all the doctor\\'s care the fever increased, and at five o\\'clock in the morning of October 26th, she succumbed to it. An hour before she sighed her last, she bade me the last farewell in the presence of the venerable ecclesiastic who had confessed her at midnight. The tears which gather fast as I write these words are probably the last honours I shall pay to this poor victim of a man who is still alive, and whose destiny seemed to be to make women unhappy. I sat weeping by the bed of her I loved so dearly, and in vain Madame Lamarre tried to induce me to come and sit with her.',\n",
       " \"I loved the poor corpse better than all the world outside. At noon my brother and his wife came to see me; they had not seen me for a week, and were getting anxious. They saw the body lovely in death; they understood my tears, and mingled theirs with mine. At last I asked them to leave me, and I remained all night by Charlotte's bed, resolved not to leave it till her body had been consigned to the grave. The day before this morning of unhappy memory my brother had given me several letters, but I had not opened any of them. On my return from the funeral I proceeded to do so, and the first one was from M. de Bragadin had been as a father to me, living poorly, and even going into debt that I might have enough. He could not leave me anything, as his property was entailed, while his furniture and his library would become the prey of his creditors. His two friends, who were my friends also, were poor, and could give me nothing but their love.\",\n",
       " \"The dreadful news was accompanied by a bill of exchange for a thousand crowns, which he had sent me twenty–four hours before his death, foreseeing that it would be the last gift he would ever make me. I was overwhelmed, and thought that Fortune had done her worst to me. I spent three days in my brother's house without going out. On the fourth I began to pay an assiduous court to Princess Lubomirska, who had written the king, her brother, a letter that must have mortified him, as she proved beyond a doubt that the tales he had listened to against me were mere calumny. But your kings do not allow so small a thing to vex or mortify them. Besides, Stanislas Augustus had just received a dreadful insult from Russia. Repnin's violence in kidnapping the three senators who had spoken their minds at the Diet was a blow which must have pierced the hapless king to the heart. The princess had left Warsaw more from hatred than love; though such was not the general opinion.\",\n",
       " \"As I had decided to visit the Court of Madrid before going to Portugal, the princess gave me a letter of introduction to the powerful Count of Aranda; and the Marquis Caraccioli, who was still at Paris, gave me three letters, one for Prince de la Catolica, the Neapolitan ambassador at Madrid, one for the Duke of Lossada, the king's favourite and lord high steward, and a third for the Marquis Mora Pignatelli. On November 4th I went to a concert with a ticket that the princess had given me. When the concert was half–way through I heard my name pronounced, accompanied by scornful laughter. I turned round and saw the gentleman who was speaking contemptuously of me. It was a tall young man sitting between two men advanced in years. I stared him in the face, but he turned his head away and continued his impertinencies, saying, amongst other things, that I had robbed him of a million francs at least by my swindling his late aunt, the Marchioness d'Urfe.\",\n",
       " '\"You are an impudent liar,\" I said to him, \"and if we were out of this room I would give you a kick to teach you to speak respectfully. \" With these words I made my way out of the hall, and on turning my head round I saw that the two elderly men were keeping the young blockhead back. I got into my carriage and waited some time, and as he did not come I drove to the theatre and chanced to find myself in the same box as Madame Valville. She informed me that she had left the boards, and was kept by the Marquis the Brunel. \" \"I should be only too happy, but unfortunately I have an engagement; but I will come and see you if you will give me your address. \" So saying, I slipped into her hand a rouleau, it being the fifty louis I owed her. \"What is this?\" \"The money you lent me so kindly at Konigsberg. \" \"This is neither the time nor the place to return it. I will only take it at my own house, so please do not insist.',\n",
       " '\" I put the money back into my pocket, she gave me her address, and I left her. Two days later, as I was at table with my brother, my sister–in–law, and some young Russians whom he was teaching to paint, I was told that a Chevalier of St. I went out, and he handed me a paper without making any preface. I opened the document, and found it was signed \"Louis. \" The great king ordered me to leave Paris in twenty–four hours and his realm of France within three weeks, and the reason assigned was: \"It is our good pleasure.',\n",
       " 'Chapter III My Departure From Paris--my Journey to Madrid--the Count of Aranda--the Prince De La Catolica--the Duke of Lossada--mengs--a Ball--madame Pichona--donna Ignazia \"Well, chevalier,\" I said, \"I have read the little note, and I will try and oblige his majesty as soon as possible. However, if I have not time to get away in twenty–four hours, his majesty must work his dread will on me. \" \"My dear sir, the twenty–four hours are a mere formality. Subscribe the order and give me a receipt for the lettre de cachet, and you can go at your convenience. All I ask of you is that you give me your word of honour not to go to the theatres or public places of amusement on foot. \" I took the chevalier to my room and gave him the necessary acknowledgment, and with the observation that he would be glad to see my brother, whom he knew already, I led him into the dining–room, and explained with a cheerful face the purport of his visit.',\n",
       " 'Buhot, this news is like March in Lent, it was quite unnecessary; my brother was going in the course of a week. If the minister had been aware of that he would not have troubled himself about it. \" \"Is the reason known?\" \"I have heard something about a proposal to kick a gentleman, who though young, is too exalted a person to be spoken to in such a manner. \" \"Why, chevalier,\" said I, \"the phrase is a mere formality like the twenty–four hours for if the impudent young rascal had come out he would have met me, and his sword should have been sufficient to ward off any kicks. \" I then told the whole story, and Buhot agreed that I was in the right throughout; adding that the police were also in the right to prevent any encounter between us. He advised me to go next morning and tell the tale to M. de Sartine, who knew me, and would be glad to have the account from my own lips. I said nothing, as I knew the famous superintendent of police to be a dreadful sermoniser.',\n",
       " \"The lettre de cachet was dated November 6th, and I did not leave Paris till the 20th. I informed all my friends of the great honour his majesty had done me, and I would not hear of Madame du Rumain appealing to the king on my behalf, though she said she felt certain she could get the order revoked. The Duc de Choiseul gave me a posting passport dated November 19th, which I still preserve. I left Paris without any servant, still grieving, though quietly, over Charlotte's fate. I had a hundred Louis in cash, and a bill of exchange on Bordeaux for eight thousand francs. I enjoyed perfect health, and almost felt as if I had been rejuvenated. I had need of the utmost prudence and discretion for the future. de Bragadin and Madame d'Urfe had left me alone in the world, and I was slowly but steadily approaching what is called a certain age, when women begin to look on a man with coldness.\",\n",
       " \"I only called on Madame Valville on the eve of my departure: and found her in a richly–furnished house, and her casket well filled with diamonds. When I proposed to return her the fifty louis, she asked me if I had got a thousand; and on learning that I had only five hundred she refused the money absolutely and offered me her purse, which I in my turn refused. I have not seen the excellent creature since then, but before I left I gave her some excellent advice as to the necessity of saving her gains for the time of her old age, when her charms would be no more. I bade farewell to my brother and my sister–in–law at six o'clock in the evening, and got into my chaise in the moonlight, intending to travel all night so as to dine next day at Orleans, where I wanted to see an old friend. In half an hour I was at Bourg–la–Reine, and there I began to fall asleep.\",\n",
       " 'Fair and beloved France, that went so well in those days, despite lettres de cachet, despite corvees, despite the people\\'s misery and the king\\'s \"good pleasure,\" dear France, where art thou now? Thy sovereign is the people now, the most brutal and tyrannical sovereign in the world. You have no longer to bear the \"good pleasure\" of the sovereign, but you have to endure the whims of the mob and the fancies of the Republic—the ruin of all good Government. A republic presupposes self– denial and a virtuous people; it cannot endure long in our selfish and luxurious days. I went to see Bodin, a dancer, who had married Madame Joffroy, one of my thousand mistresses whom I had loved twenty–two years ago, and had seen later at Turin, Paris, and Vienna. These meetings with old friends and sweethearts were always a weak or rather a strong point with me. For a moment I seemed to be young again, and I fed once more on the delights of long ago.',\n",
       " 'Bodin and his wife (who was rather ugly than old–looking, and had become pious to suit her husband\\'s tastes, thus giving to God the devil\\'s leavings), Bodin, I say, lived on a small estate he had purchased, and attributed all the agricultural misfortunes he met with in the course of the year to the wrath of an avenging Deity. I had a fasting dinner with them, for it was Friday, and they strictly observed all the rules of the Church. I told them of my adventures of the past years, and when I had finished they proceeded to make reflections on the faults and failings of men who have not God for a guide. They told me what I knew already: that I had an immortal soul, that there was a God that judgeth righteously, and that it was high time for me to take example by them, and to renounce all the pomps and vanities of the world. \"And turn Capuchin, I suppose?\" \"You might do much worse. \" \"Very good; but I shall wait till my beard grows the necessary length in a single night.',\n",
       " '\" In spite of their silliness, I was not sorry to have spent six hours with these good creatures who seemed sincerely repentant and happy in their way, and after an affectionate embrace I took leave of them and travelled all night. I stopped at Chanteloup to see the monument of the taste and magnificence of the Duc de Choiseul, and spent twenty–four hours there. A gentlemanly and polished individual, who did not know me, and for whom I had no introduction, lodged me in a fine suite of rooms, gave me supper, and would only sit down to table with me after I had used all my powers of persuasion. The next day he treated me in the same way, gave me an excellent dinner, shewed me everything, and behaved as if I were some prince, though he did not even ask my name. His attentions even extended to seeing that none of his servants were at hand when I got into my carriage and drove off. The castle on which the Duc de Choiseul had spent such immense sums had in reality cost him nothing.',\n",
       " 'It was all owing, but he did not trouble himself about that in the slightest degree, as he was a sworn foe to the principle of meum and tuum. He never paid his creditors, and never disturbed his debtors. He was a generous man; a lover of art and artists, to whom he liked to be of service, and what they did for him he looked upon as a grateful offering. He was intellectual, but a hater of all detail and minute research, being of a naturally indolent and procrastinating disposition. His favourite saying was, \"There\\'s time enough for that. \" When I got to Poitiers, I wanted to push on to Vivonne; it was seven o\\'clock in the evening, and two girls endeavoured to dissuade me from this course. \"It\\'s very cold,\" said they, \"and the road is none of the best. You are no courier, sup here, we will give you a good bed, and you shall start again in the morning. \" \"I have made up my mind to go on, but if you will keep me company at supper I will stay.',\n",
       " '\" \"Then lay the table for three; I must go on in an hour. \" \"In an hour! You mean three, sir; papa will take two hours to get you a good supper. \" \"Then I will not go on, but you must keep me company all night. \" These two minxes gave me an excellent supper, and were a match for me in drinking as well as eating. The wine was delicious, and we stayed at table till midnight, laughing and joking together, though without overstepping the bounds of propriety. About midnight, the father came in jovially, and asked me how I had enjoyed my supper. \"Very much,\" I answered, \"but I have enjoyed still more the company of your charming daughters. Whenever you come this way they shall keep you company, but now it is past midnight, and time for them to go to bed. \" I nodded my head, for Charlotte\\'s death was still too fresh in my memory to admit of my indulging in any voluptuous pleasures.',\n",
       " \"I wished the girls a pleasant sleep, and I do not think I should even have kissed them if the father had not urged me to do this honour to their charms. However, my vanity made me put some fire into the embrace, and I have no doubt they thought me a prey to vain desires. When I was alone I reflected that if I did not forget Charlotte I was a lost man. I slept till nine o'clock, and I told the servant that came to light my fire to get coffee for three, and to have my horses put in. The two pretty girls came to breakfast with me, and I thanked them for having made me stay the night. I asked for the bill, and the eldest said it was in round figures a Louis apiece. I shewed no sign of anger at this outrageous fleecing, but gave them three Louis with the best grace imaginable and went on my way. When I reached Angouleme, where I expected to find Noel, the King of Prussia's cook, I only found his father, whose talents in the matter of pates was something prodigious.\",\n",
       " 'He said he would send his pates all over Europe to any address I liked to give him. You need only give me your address, and you need not pay me till you get the pates. \" I sent his pates to my friends in Venice, Warsaw, and Turin, and everybody thanked me for the delicious dish. He assured me he had sent large consignments to America, and with the exception of some losses by shipwreck all the pates had arrived in excellent condition. They were chiefly made of turkeys, partridges, and hare, seasoned with truffles, but he also made pates de foie gras of larks and of thrushes, according to the season. In two days I arrived at Bordeaux, a beautiful town coming only second to Paris, with respect to Lyons be it said. I spent a week there, eating and drinking of the best, for the living there is the choicest in the world. I transferred my bill of exchange for eight thousand francs to a Madrid house, and crossed the Landes, passing by Mont de Marsan, Bayonne, and St.',\n",
       " 'Jean de Luz I went to Pampeluna by way of the Pyrenees, which I crossed on mule–back, my baggage being carried by another mule. In this I may possibly be wrong, but I am certain that the Pyrenees are the most picturesque, fertile, and agreeable of the two. At Pampeluna a man named Andrea Capello took charge of me and my luggage, and we set out for Madrid. For the first twenty leagues the travelling was easy enough, and the roads as good as any in France. de Gages, who had administered Navarre after the Italian war, and had, as I was assured, made the road at his own expense. Twenty years earlier I had been arrested by this famous general; but he had established a claim on posterity greater than any of his victories. These laurels were dyed in blood, but the maker of a good road is a solid benefactor of all posterity. In time this road came to an end, and thenceforth it would be incorrect to say that the roads were bad, for, to tell the truth, there were no roads at all.',\n",
       " \"There were steep ascents and violent descents, but no traces of carriage wheels, and so it is throughout the whole of Old Castile. There are no good inns, only miserable dens scarce good enough for the muleteers, who make their beds beside their animals. Signor or rather Senor Andrea tried to choose the least wretched inns for me, and after having provided for the mules he would go round the entire village to get something for me to eat. The landlord would not stir; he shewed me a room where I could sleep if I liked, containing a fire–place, in which I could light a fire if I thought fit, but as to procuring firewood or provisions, he left that all to me. Wretched Spain! The sum asked for a night's accommodation was less than a farmer would ask in France or Germany for leave to sleep in his barn; but there was always an extra charge of a 'pizetta por el ruido'. The pizetta is worth four reals; about twenty–one French sous.\",\n",
       " 'The landlord smoked his paper cigarette nonchalantly enough, blowing clouds of smoke into the air with immense dignity. To him poverty was as good as riches; his wants were small, and his means sufficed for them. In no country in Europe do the lower orders live so contentedly on a very little as in Spain. Two ounces of white bread, a handful of roast chestnuts or acorns (called bellotas in Spanish) suffice to keep a Spaniard for a day. It is his glory to say when a stranger is departing from his abode,— \"I have not given myself any trouble in waiting on him. \" This proceeds in part from idleness and in part from Castilian pride. A Castilian should not lower himself, they say, by attending on a Gavacho, by which name the Spaniards know the French, and, indeed, all foreigners. It is not so offensive as the Turkish appellation of dog, or the damned foreigner of the English.',\n",
       " \"Of course, persons who have travelled or have had a liberal education do not speak in this way, and a respectable foreigner will find reasonable Spaniards as he will find reasonable Turks and Englishmen. On the second night of my journey I slept at Agreda, a small and ugly town, or rather village. There Sister Marie d'Agreda became so crazy as to write a life of the Virgin, which she affirmed to have been dictated to her by the Mother of the Lord. The State Inquisitors had given me this work to read when I was under the Leads, and it had nearly driven me mad. We did ten Spanish leagues a day, and long and weary leagues they seemed to me. One morning I thought I saw a dozen Capuchins walking slowly in front of us, but when we caught them up I found they were women of all ages. They wear the Capuchin habit out of devotion, and you would not find a chemise on one of them.\",\n",
       " '\" There was nothing surprising in their not having chemises, for the chemise is a scarce article in Spain, but the idea of pleasing God by wearing a Capuchin\\'s habit struck me as extremely odd. I will here relate an amusing adventure which befell me on my way. At the gate of a town not far from Madrid I was asked for my passport. I found the chief of the customs\\' house engaged in an argument with a foreign priest who was on his way to Madrid, and had no passport for the capital. He skewed one he had had for Bilbao, but the official was not satisfied. The priest was a Sicilian, and I asked him why he had exposed himself to being placed in this disagreeable predicament. He said he thought it was unnecessary to have a passport in Spain when one had once journeyed in the country. \"I want to go to Madrid,\" said he to me, \"and hope to obtain a chaplaincy in the house of a grandee.',\n",
       " '\" The poor priest drew out the letter and skewed it to the official, who opened it, looked at the signature, and absolutely shrieked when he saw the name Squillace. \"What, senor abbe! you are going to Madrid with a letter from Squillace, and you dare to skew it?\" The clerks, constables, and hangers–on, hearing that the hated Squillace, who would have been stoned to death if it had not been for the king\\'s protection, was the poor abbe\\'s only patron, began to beat him violently, much to the poor Sicilian\\'s astonishment. I interposed, however, and after some trouble I succeeded in rescuing the priest, who was then allowed to pass, as I believe, as a set–off against the blows he had received. Squillace was sent to Venice as Spanish ambassador, and in Venice he died at an advanced age. He was a man designed to be an object of intense hatred to the people; he was simply ruthless in his taxation. The door of my room had a lock on the outside but none on the inside.',\n",
       " 'For the first and second night I let it pass, but on the third I told Senor Andrea that I must have it altered. \"Senor Don Jacob, you must bear with it in Spain, for the Holy Inquisition must always be at liberty to inspect the rooms of foreigners. \" \"But what in the devil\\'s name does your cursed Inquisition want … ?\" \"For the love of God, Senor Jacob, speak not thus! if you were overheard we should both be undone. \" \"Well, what can the Holy Inquisition want to know?\" \"Everything. It wants to know whether you eat meat on fast days, whether persons of opposite sexes sleep together, if so, whether they are married, and if not married it will cause both parties to be imprisoned; in fine, Senor Don Jaimo, the Holy inquisition is continually watching over our souls in this country. \" When we met a priest bearing the viaticum to some sick man, Senor Andrea would tell me imperatively to get out of my carriage, and then there was no choice but to kneel in the mud or dust as the case might be.',\n",
       " \"The chief subject of dispute at that time was the fashion of wearing breeches. Those who wore 'braguettes' were imprisoned, and all tailors making breeches with 'braguettes' were severely punished. Nevertheless, people persisted in wearing them, and the priests and monks preached in vain against the indecency of such a habit. A revolution seemed imminent, but the matter was happily settled without effusion of blood. An edict was published and affixed to the doors of all the churches, in which it was declared that breeches with braguettes were only to be worn by the public hangmen. Then the fashion passed away; for no one cared to pass for the public executioner. By little and little I got an insight into the manners of the Spanish nation as I passed through Guadalaxara and Alcala, and at length arrived at Madrid. Guadalaxara, or Guadalajara, is pronounced by the Spaniards with a strong aspirate, the x and j having the same force.\",\n",
       " \"The vowel d, the queen of letters, reigns supreme in Spain; it is a relic of the old Moorish language. Everyone knows that the Arabic abounds in d's, and perhaps the philologists are right in calling it the most ancient of languages, since the a is the most natural and easy to pronounce of all the letters. It seems to me very mistaken to call such words as Achald, Ayanda, Almanda, Acard, Agracaramba, Alcantara, etc. , barbarous, for the sonorous ring with which they are pronounced renders the Castilian the richest of all modern languages. Spanish is undoubtedly one of the finest, most energetic, and most majestic languages in the world. When it is pronounced 'ore rotundo' it is susceptible of the most poetic harmony. It would be superior to the Italian, if it were not for the three guttural letters, in spite of what the Spaniards say to the contrary.\",\n",
       " 'As I was entering the Gate of Alcala, my luggage was searched, and the clerks paid the greatest attention to my books, and they were very disappointed only to find the \"Iliad\" in Greek, and a Latin Horace. They were taken away, but three days after, they were returned to me at my lodging in the Rue de la Croix where I had gone in spite of Senor Andrea, who had wanted to take me elsewhere. A worthy man whom I had met in Bordeaux had given me the address. One of the ceremonies I had to undergo at the Gate of Alcala displeased me in the highest degree. A clerk asked me for a pinch of snuff, so I took out my snuff–box and gave it him, but instead of taking a pinch he snatched it out of my hands and said,— \"Senor, this snuff will not pass in Spain\" (it was French rappee); and after turning it out on the ground he gave me back the box. The authorities are most rigorous on the matter of this innocent powder, and in consequence an immense contraband trade is carried on.',\n",
       " 'The spies employed by the Spanish snuff–makers are always on the look–out after foreign snuff, and if they detect anyone carrying it they make him pay dearly for the luxury. The ambassadors of foreign powers are the only persons exempted from the prohibitions. The king who stuffs into his enormous nose one enormous pinch as he rises in the morning wills that all his subjects buy their snuff of the Spanish manufacturers. When Spanish snuff is pure it is very good, but at the time I was in Spain the genuine article could hardly be bought for its weight in gold. By reason of the natural inclination towards forbidden fruit, the Spaniards are extremely fond of foreign snuff, and care little for their own; thus snuff is smuggled to an enormous extent. My lodging was comfortable enough, but I felt the want of a fire as the cold was more trying than that of Paris, in spite of the southern latitude. The cause of this cold is that Madrid is the highest town in Europe.',\n",
       " 'From whatever part of the coast one starts, one has to mount to reach the capital. The town is also surrounded by mountains and hills, so that the slightest touch of wind from the north makes the cold intense. The air of Madrid is not healthy for strangers, especially for those of a full habit of body; the Spaniards it suits well enough, for they are dry and thin, and wear a cloak even in the dog days. The men of Spain dwell mentally in a limited horizon, bounded by prejudice on every side; but the women, though ignorant, are usually intelligent; while both sexes are the prey of desires, as lively as their native air, as burning as the sun that shines on them. Every Spaniard hates a foreigner, simply because he is a foreigner, but the women avenge us by loving us, though with great precautions, for your Spaniard is intensely jealous. They watch most jealously over the honour of their wives and daughters.',\n",
       " 'As a rule the men are ugly, though there are numerous exceptions; while the women are pretty, and beauties are not uncommon. The southern blood in their veins inclines them to love, and they are always ready to enter into an intrigue and to deceive the spies by whom they are surrounded. The lover who runs the greatest dangers is always the favourite. In the public walks, the churches, the theatres, the Spanish women are always speaking the language of the eyes. If the person to whom it is addressed knows how to seize the instant, he may be sure of success, but if not, the opportunity will never be offered him again. I required some kind of heat in my room, and could not bear a charcoal brazier, so I incited an ingenious tin–smith to make me a stove with a pipe going out of the window. However, he was so proud of his success that he made me pay dearly. Before the stove was ready I was told where I might go and warm myself an hour before noon, and stay till dinner–time.',\n",
       " 'It is called La Pueyta del Sol, \"The Gate of the Sun. \" It is not a gate, but it takes its name from the manner in which the source of all heat lavishes his treasures there, and warms all who come and bask in his rays. I found a numerous company promenading there, walking and talking, but it was not much to my taste. I wanted a servant who could speak French, and I had the greatest difficulty in getting one, and had to pay dearly, for in Madrid the kind of man I wanted was called a page. I could not compel him to mount behind my carriage, nor to carry a package, nor to light me by night with a torch or lantern. My page was a man of thirty, and terribly ugly; but this was a recommendation, as his ugliness secured him from the jealous suspicions of husbands. A woman of rank will not drive out without one of these pages seated in the forepart of her carriage. They are said to be more difficult to seduce than the strictest of duennas.',\n",
       " 'I was obliged to take one of these rascally tribe into my service, and I wish he had broken his leg on his way to my house. I delivered all my introductions, beginning with the letter from Princess Lubomirska to the Count of Aranda. The count had covered himself with glory by driving the Jesuits out of Spain. He was more powerful than the king himself, and never went out without a number of the royal guardsmen about him, whom he made to sit down at his table. Of course all the Spaniards hated him, but he did not seem to care much for that. A profound politician, and absolutely resolute and firm, he privately indulged in every luxury that he forbade to others, and did not care whether people talked of it or not. He was a rather ugly man, with a disagreeable squint. \"To add fresh treasures to my store of experience, by observing the manners and the customs of the country, and if possible to serve the Government with such feeble, talents as I may possess.',\n",
       " 'If you do not infringe the laws, no one will disturb you. As to your obtaining employment, you had better go to the representative of your country; he will introduce you at Court, and make you known. \" \"My lord, the Venetian ambassador will do nothing for me; I am in disgrace with the Government. \" \"Then I would advise you to give up all hopes of employment, for the king would begin by asking your ambassador about you, and his answer would be fatal. You will do well to be satisfied with amusing yourself. \" After this I called on the Neapolitan ambassador, who talked in much the same way. Even the Marquis of Moras, one of the most pleasant men in Spain, did not hold out any hopes. The Duke of Lossada, the high steward and favourite of his Catholic majesty, was sorry to be disabled from doing me any service, in spite of his good will, and advised me, in some way or other, to get the Venetian ambassador to give me a good word, in spite of my disgrace.',\n",
       " 'Dandolo, begging him to get the ambassador to favour me at the Spanish Court in spite of my quarrel with the Venetian Government. I worded my letter in such a way that it might be read by the Inquisitors themselves, and calculated on its producing a good impression. After I had written this letter I went to the lodging of the Venetian ambassador, and presented myself to the secretary, Gaspar Soderini, a worthy and intelligent man. Nevertheless, he dared to tell me that he was astonished at my hardihood in presenting myself at the embassy. \"I have presented myself, sir, that my enemies may never reproach me for not having done so; I am not aware that I have ever done anything which makes me too infamous to call on my ambassador. I should have credited myself with much greater hardihood if I had left without fulfilling this duty; but I shall be sorry if the ambassador views my proceedings in the same light as yourself, and puts down to temerity what was meant for a mark of respect.',\n",
       " 'I shall be none the less astonished if his excellency refuses to receive me on account of a private quarrel between myself and the State Inquisitors, of which he knows no more than I do, and I know nothing. You will excuse my saying that he is not the ambassador of the State Inquisitors, but of the Republic of which I am a subject; for I defy him and I defy the Inquisitors to tell me what crime I have committed that I am to be deprived of my rights as a Venetian citizen. I think that, while it is my duty to reverence my prince in the person of my ambassador, it is his duty to afford me his protection. \" This speech had made Soderini blush, and he replied,— \"Why don\\'t you write a letter to the ambassador, with the arguments you have just used to me?\" \"I could not write to him before I know whether he will receive me or not. But now, as I have reason to suppose that his opinions are much the same as your own, I will certainly write to him.',\n",
       " '\" \"I do not know whether his excellency thinks as I do or not, and, in spite of what I said to you, it is just possible that you do not know my own opinions on the question; but write to him, and he may possibly give you an audience. \" \"I shall follow your advice, for which I am much obliged. \" When I got home I wrote to his excellency all I had said to the secretary, and the next day I had a visit from Count Manucci. The count proved to be a fine–looking young man of an agreeable presence. He said that he lived in the embassy, that his excellency had read my letter, and though he grieved not to receive me publicly he should be delighted to see me in private, for he both knew and esteemed me. Young Manucci told me that he was a Venetian, and that he knew me by name, as he often heard his father and mother lamenting my fortune.',\n",
       " 'Before long it dawned upon me that this Count Manucci was the son of that Jean Baptiste Manucci who had served as the spy of the State Inquisitors and had so adroitly managed to get possession of my books of magic, which were in all probability the chief corpus delicti. I did not say anything to him, but I was certain that my guess was correct. His mother was the daughter of a valet de chambre, and his father was a poor mechanic. I asked the young man if he were called count at the embassy, and he said he bore the title in virtue of a warrant from the elector–palatine. My question skewed him that I knew his origin, and he began to speak openly to me; and knowing that I was acquainted with the peculiar tastes of M. de Mocenigo, the ambassador, he informed me laughingly that he was his pathic. \"I will do my best for you,\" he added; and I was glad to hear him say so, for an Alexis should be able to obtain almost anything from his Corydon.',\n",
       " 'We embraced, and he told me as we parted that he would expect me at the embassy in the afternoon, to take coffee in his room; the ambassador, he said, would certainly come in as soon as he heard of my presence. I went to the embassy, and had a very kind reception from the ambassador, who said he was deeply grieved not to be able to receive me publicly. He admitted that he might present me at Court without compromising himself, but he was afraid of making enemies. \"I hope soon to receive a letter from a friend of mine, which will authorise your excellency producing me. \" \"I shall be delighted, in that case, to present you to all the Spanish ministers. \" This Mocenigo was the same that acquired such a reputation at Paris by his leanings to pederasty, a vice or taste which the French hold in horror. Later on, Mocenigo was condemned by the Council of Ten to ten years\\' imprisonment for having started on an embassy to Vienna without formal permission.',\n",
       " \"Maria Theresa had intimated to the Venetian Government that she would not receive such a character, as his habits would be the scandal of her capital. The Venetian Government had some trouble with Mocenigo, and as he attempted to set out for Vienna they exiled him and chose another ambassador, whose morals were as bad, save that the new ambassador indulged himself with Hebe and not Ganymede, which threw a veil of decency over his proceedings. In spite of his reputation for pederasty, Mocenigo was much liked at Madrid. On one occasion I was at a ball, and a Spaniard noticing me with Manucci, came up to me, and told me with an air of mystery that that young man was the ambassador's wife. He did not know that the ambassador was Manucci's wife; in fact, he did not understand the arrangement at all. However, in spite of the revolting nature of this vice, it has been a favourite one with several great men.\",\n",
       " \"It was well–known to the Ancients, and those who indulged in it were called Hermaphrodites, which symbolises not a man of two sexes but a man with the passions of the two sexes. I had called two or three times on the painter Mengs, who had been painter in ordinary to his Catholic majesty for six years, and had an excellent salary. His wife and family were at Rome, while he basked in the royal favours at Madrid, enjoying the unusual privilege of being able to speak to the king whenever he would. At Mengs's house I trade the acquaintance of the architect Sabatini, an extremely able man whom the king had summoned from Naples to cleanse Madrid, which was formerly the dirtiest and most stinking town in Europe, or, for the matter of that, in the world. Sabatini had become a rich man by constructing drains, sewers, and closets for a city of fourteen thousand houses. He had married by proxy the daughter of Vanvitelli, who was also an architect at Naples, but he had never seen her.\",\n",
       " \"She was a beauty of eighteen, and no sooner did she see her husband than she declared she would never be his wife. Sabatini was neither a young man nor a handsome one, but he was kind–hearted and distinguished; and when he told his young wife that she would have to choose between him and a nunnery, she determined to make the best of what she thought a bad bargain. However, she had no reason to repent of her choice; her husband was rich, affectionate, and easygoing, and gave her everything she wanted. I sighed and burned for her in silence, not daring to declare my love, for while the wound of the death of Charlotte was still bleeding I also began to find that women were beginning to give me the cold shoulder. By way of amusing myself I began to go to the theatre, and the masked balls to which the Count of Aranda had established. They were held in a room built for the purpose, and named 'Los Scannos del Peral'.\",\n",
       " 'A Spanish play is full of absurdities, but I rather relished the representations. The \\'Autos Sacramentales\\' were still represented; they were afterwards prohibited. I could not help remarking the strange way in which the boxes are constructed by order of the wretched police. Instead of being boarded in front they are perfectly open, being kept up by small pillars. A devotee once said to me at the theatre that this was a very wise regulation, and he was surprised that it was not carried into force in Italy. \"Why so?\" \"Because lovers, who feel sure that no one in the pit can see them, may commit improprieties. In a large box opposite to the stage sat \\'los padres\\' of the Holy Inquisition to watch over the morals of actors and audience.',\n",
       " 'I was gazing on them when of a sudden the sentinel at the door of the pit called out \"Dios!\" and at this cry all the actors and all the audience, men and women, fell down on their knees, and remained kneeling till the sound of a bell in the street ceased to be heard. This bell betokened that a priest was passing by carrying the viaticum to some sick man. I felt very much inclined to laugh, but I had seen enough of Spanish manners to refrain. All the religion of the Spaniard is in outward show and ceremony. A profligate woman before yielding to the desires of her lover covers the picture of Christ, or the Virgin, with a veil. If the lover laughed at this absurdity he would run a risk of being denounced as an Atheist, and most probably by the wretched woman who had sold him her charms.',\n",
       " 'In Madrid, and possibly all over Spain, a gentleman who takes a lady to a private room in an inn must expect to have a servant in the room the whole of the time, that he may be able to swear that the couple took no indecent liberties with each other. In spite of all, profligacy is rampant at Madrid, and also the most dreadful hypocrisy, which is more offensive to true piety than open sin. Men and women seemed to have come to an agreement to set the whole system of surveillance utterly at nought. However, commerce with women is not without its dangers; whether it be endemic or a result of dirty habits, one has often good reason to repent the favours one has obtained.',\n",
       " 'The first time I went to see what it was like and it only cost me a doubloon (about eleven francs), but ever after it cost me four doubloons, for the following reason: An elderly gentleman, who sat next me at supper, guessed I was a foreigner by my difficulty in making myself understood by the waiter, and asked me where, I had left my lady friend. \"I have not got one; I came by myself to enjoy this delightful and excellently–managed entertainment. \" \"Yes, but you ought to come with a companion; then you could dance. At present you cannot do so, as every lady has her partner, who will not allow her to dance with anyone else. \" \"Then I must be content not to dance, for, being a stranger, I do not know any lady whom I can ask to come with me. \" \"As a stranger you would have much less difficulty in securing a partner than a citizen of Madrid. Under the new fashion, introduced by the Count of Aranda, the masked ball has become the rage of all the women in the capital.',\n",
       " 'You see there are about two hundred of them on the floor to– night; well, I think there are at least four thousand girls in Madrid who are sighing for someone to take them to the ball, for, as you may know, no woman is allowed to come by herself. You would only have to go to any respectable people, give your name and address, and ask to have the pleasure of taking their daughter to the ball. You would have to send her a domino, mask, and gloves; and you would take her and bring her back in your carriage. \" \"And if the father and mother refused?\" \"Then you would make your bow and go, leaving them to repent of their folly, for the girl would sigh, and weep, and moan, bewail parental tyranny, call Heaven to witness the innocency of going to a ball, and finally go into convulsions. \" This oration, which was uttered in the most persuasive style, made me quite gay, for I scented an intrigue from afar.',\n",
       " 'I thanked the masked (who spoke Italian very well) and promised to follow his advice and to let him know the results. \"I shall be delighted to hear of your success, and you will find me in the box, where I shall be glad if you will follow me now, to be introduced to the lady who is my constant companion. \" I was astonished at so much politeness, and told him my name and followed him. He took me into a box where there were two ladies and an elderly man. They were talking about the ball, so I put in a remark or two on the same topic, which seemed to meet with approval. One of the two ladies, who retained some traces of her former beauty, asked me, in excellent French, what circles I moved in. \"I have only been a short time in Madrid, and not having been presented at Court I really know no one. My name is Pichona, and anybody will tell you where I live. \" \"I shall be delighted to pay my respects to you, madam.',\n",
       " '\" What I liked best about the spectacle was a wonderful and fantastic dance which was struck up at midnight. It was the famous fandango, of which I had often heard, but of which I had absolutely no idea. I had seen it danced on the stage in France and Italy, but the actors were careful not to use those voluptuous gestures which make it the most seductive in the world. Each couple only dances three steps, but the gestures and the attitudes are the most lascivious imaginable. Everything is represented, from the sigh of desire to the final ecstasy; it is a very history of love. I could not conceive a woman refusing her partner anything after this dance, for it seemed made to stir up the senses. I was so excited at this Bacchanalian spectacle that I burst out into cries of delight. The masker who had taken me to his box told me that I should see the fandango danced by the Gitanas with good partners.',\n",
       " '\"But,\" I remarked, \"does not the Inquisition object to this dance?\" Madame Pichona told me that it was absolutely forbidden, and would not be danced unless the Count of Aranda had given permission. I heard afterwards that, on the count forbidding the fandango, the ball– room was deserted with bitter complaints, and on the prohibition being withdrawn everyone was loud in his praise. The next day I told my infamous page to get me a Spaniard who would teach me the fandango. He brought me an actor, who also gave me Spanish lessons, for he pronounced the language admirably. In the course of three days the young actor taught me all the steps so well that, by the confession of the Spaniards themselves, I danced it to perfection. For the next ball I determined to carry the masker\\'s advice into effect, but I did not want to take a courtesan or a married woman with me, and I could not reasonably expect that any young lady of family would accompany me.',\n",
       " \"Anthony's Day, and passing the Church of the Soledad I went in, with the double motive of hearing mass and of procuring a partner for the next day's ball. I noticed a fine–looking girl coming out of the confessional, with contrite face and lowered eyes, and I noted where she went. She knelt down in the middle of the church, and I was so attracted by her appearance that I registered a mental vow to the effect that she should be my first partner. She did not look like a person of condition, nor, so far as I could see, was she rich, and nothing about her indicated the courtesan, though women of that class go to confession in Madrid like everybody else. When mass was ended, the priest distributed the Eucharist, and I saw her rise and approach humbly to the holy table, and there receive the communion. She then returned to the church to finish her devotions, and I was patient enough to wait till they were over. At last she left, in company with another girl, and I followed her at a distance.\",\n",
       " 'At the end of a street her companion left her to go into her house, and she, retracing her steps, turned into another street and entered a small house, one story high. I noted the house and the street (Calle des Desinjano) and then walked up and down for half an hour, that I might not be suspected of following her. At last I took courage and walked in, and, on my ringing a bell, I heard a voice, \"Who is there?\" \"Honest folk,\" I answered, according to the custom of the country; and the door was opened. I found myself in the presence of a man, a woman, the young devotee I had followed, and another girl, somewhat ugly. My Spanish was bad, but still it was good enough to express my meaning, and, hat in hand, I informed the father that, being a stranger, and having no partner to take to the ball, I had come to ask him to give me his daughter for my partner, supposing he had a daughter.',\n",
       " 'I assured him that I was a man of honour, and that the girl should be returned to him after the ball in the same condition as when she started. \"Senor,\" said he, \"there is my daughter, but I don\\'t know you, and I don\\'t know whether she wants to go. \" \"I should like to go, if my parents will allow me. \" \"Then you know this gentleman?\" \"I have never seen him, and I suppose he has never seen me. \" The father asked me my name and address, and promised I should have a decisive answer by dinner–time, if I dined at home. I begged him to excuse the liberty I had taken, and to let me know his answer without fail, so that I might have time to get another partner if it were unfavourable to me. I asked him to sit down, and he informed me that his daughter would accept my offer, but that her mother would accompany her and sleep in the carriage. I said that she might do so if she liked, but I should be sorry for her on account of the cold.',\n",
       " '\"She shall have a good cloak,\" said he; and he proceeded to inform me that he was a cordwainer. \"Then I hope you will take my measure for a pair of shoes. \" \"I daren\\'t do that; I\\'m an hidalgo, and if I were to take anyone\\'s measure I should have to touch his foot, and that would be a degradation. I am a cobbler, and that is not inconsistent with my nobility. \" \"Then, will you mend me these boots?\" \"I will make them like new; but I see they want a lot of work; it will cost you a pezzo duro, about five francs. \" I told him that I thought his terms very reasonable, and he went out with a profound bow, refusing absolutely to dine with me. Here was a cobbler who despised bootmakers because they had to touch the foot, and they, no doubt, despised him because he touched old leather.',\n",
       " \"Unhappy pride how many forms it assumes, and who is without his own peculiar form of it? The next day I sent to the gentleman–cobbler's a tradesman with dominos, masks, and gloves; but I took care not to go myself nor to send my page, for whom I had an aversion which almost amounted to a presentiment. I hired a carriage to seat four, and at nightfall I drove to the house of my pious partner, who was quite ready for me. The happy flush on her face was a sufficient index to me of the feelings of her heart. We got into the carriage with the mother, who was wrapped up in a vast cloak, and at the door of the dancing–room we descended, leaving the mother in the carriage. As soon as we were alone my fair partner told me that her name was Donna Ignazia.\",\n",
       " \"Chapter IV My Amours With Donna Ignazia--my Imprisonment at Buen Retiro--my Triumph--I Am Commended to the Venetian Ambassador by One of the State Inquisitors We entered the ball–room and walked round several times. Donna Ignazia was in such a state of ecstasy that I felt her trembling, and augured well for my amorous projects. Though liberty, nay, license, seemed to reign supreme, there was a guard of soldiers ready to arrest the first person who created any disturbance. We danced several minuets and square dances, and at ten o'clock we went into the supper–room, our conversation being very limited all the while, she not speaking for fear of encouraging me too much, and I on account of my poor knowledge of the Spanish language.\",\n",
       " 'I left her alone for a moment after supper, and went to the box, where I expected to find Madame Pichona, but it was occupied by maskers, who were unknown to me, so I rejoined my partner, and we went on dancing the minuets and quadrilles till the fandango was announced. I took my place with my partner, who danced it admirably, and seemed astonished to find herself so well supported by a foreigner. This dance had excited both of us, so, after taking her to the buffet and giving her the best wines and liqueurs procurable, I asked her if she were content with me. I added that I was so deeply in love with her that unless she found some means of making me happy I should undoubtedly die of love. \"By making you happy,\" she replied, \"I shall make myself happy, too. I will write to you to–morrow, and you will find the letter sewn into the hood of my domino. \" \"You will find me ready to do anything, fair Ignazia, if you will give me hope.',\n",
       " '\" At last the ball was over, and we went out and got into the carriage. The mother woke up, and the coachman drove off, and I, taking the girl\\'s hands, would have kissed them. However, she seemed to suspect that I had other intentions, and held my hands clasped so tightly that I believe I should have found it a hard task to pull them away. In this position Donna Ignazia proceeded to tell her mother all about the ball, and the delight it had given her. She did not let go my hands till we got to the corner of their street, when the mother called out to the coachman to stop, not wishing to give her neighbours occasion for slander by stopping in front of their own house. The next day I sent for the domino, and in it I found a letter from Donna Ignazia, in which she told me that a Don Francisco de Ramos would call on me, that he was her lover, and that he would inform me how to render her and myself happy.',\n",
       " 'Don Francisco wasted no time, for the next morning at eight o\\'clock my page sent in his name. He told me that Donna Ignazia, with whom he spoke every night, she being at her window and he in the street, had informed him that she and I had been at the ball together. She had also told him that she felt sure I had conceived a fatherly affection for her, and she had consequently prevailed upon him to call on me, being certain that I would treat him as my own son. She had encouraged him to ask me to lend him a hundred doubloons which would enable them to get married before the end of the carnival. \"I am employed at the Mint,\" he added, \"but my present salary is a very small one. I hope I shall get an increase before long, and then I shall be in a position to make Ignazia happy. All my relations live at Toledo, and I have no friends at Madrid, so when we set up our only friends will be the father and mother of my wife and yourself, for I am sure you love her like a daughter.',\n",
       " '\" \"You have probed my heart to its core,\" I replied, \"but just now I am awaiting remittances, and have very little money about me. You may count on my discretion, and I shall be delighted to see you whenever you care to call on me. \" The gallant made me a bow, and took his departure in no good humour. Don Francisco was a young man of twenty–two, ugly and ill–made. I resolved to nip the intrigue in the bud, for my inclination for Donna Ignazia was of the lightest description; and I went to call on Madame Pichona, who had given me such a polite invitation to come and see her. I had made enquiries about her, and had found out that she was an actress and had been made rich by the Duke of Medina–Celi. The duke had paid her a visit in very cold weather, and finding her without a fire, as she was too poor to buy coals, had sent her the next day a silver stove, which he had filled with a hundred thousand pezzos duros in gold, amounting to three hundred thousand francs in French money.',\n",
       " 'Since then Madame Pichona lived at her ease and received good company. She gave me a warm reception when I called on her, but her looks were sad. I began by saying that as I had not found her in her box on the last ball night I had ventured to come to enquire after her health. \"I did not go,\" said she, \"for on that day died my only friend the Duke of Medina–Celi. \" \"Where have I seen him?\" \"Did he not bring you to my box?\" \"You don\\'t say so! He did not tell me his name and I never saw him before. \" I was grieved to hear of his death; it was in all probability a misfortune for me as well as Madame Pichona. All the duke\\'s estate passed to a son of miserly disposition, who in his turn had a son who was beginning to evince the utmost extravagance. I was told that the family of Medina–Celi enjoys thirty titles of nobility. One day a young man called on me to offer me, as a foreigner, his services in a country which he knew thoroughly.',\n",
       " '\"I am Count Marazzini de Plaisance,\" he began, \"I am not rich and I have come to Madrid to try and make my fortune. I hope to enter the bodyguard of his Catholic majesty. I have been indulging in the amusements of the town ever since I came. I don\\'t ask you to tell me her name, but if you are fond of novelty I can introduce you to all the handsomest girls in Madrid. \" If my experience had taught me such wholesome lessons as I might have expected, I should have shown the impudent rascal the door. Alas! I began to be weary of my experience and the fruits of it; I began to feel the horrors of a great void; I had need of some slight passion to wile away the dreary hours. I therefore made this Mercury welcome, and told him I should be obliged by his presenting me to some beauties, neither too easy nor too difficult to access. \"Come with me to the ball,\" he rejoined, \"and I will shew you some women worthy of your attention.',\n",
       " '\" The ball was to take place the same evening, and I agreed; he asked me to give him some dinner, and I agreed to that also. After dinner he told me he had no money, and I was foolish enough to give him a doubloon. The fellow, who was ugly, blind of one eye, and full of impudence, shewed me a score of pretty women, whose histories he told me, and seeing me to be interested in one of them he promised to bring her to a procuress. He kept his word, but he cost me dear; for the girl only served for an evening\\'s amusement. Towards the end of the carnival the noble Don Diego, the father of Donna Ignazia, brought me my boots, and the thanks of his wife and himself for the pleasure I had given her at the ball. \"She is as good as she is beautiful,\" said I, \"she deserves to prosper, and if I have not called on her it is only that I am anxious to do nothing which could injure her reputation.',\n",
       " '\" \"Her reputation, Senor Caballero, is above all reproach, and I shall be delighted to see you whenever you honour me with a call. \" \"The carnival draws near to its end,\" I replied, \"and if Donna Ignazia would like to go to another ball I shall be happy to take her again. \" I was anxious to see how the pious girl, who had tried to make me pay a hundred doubloons for the chance of having her after her marriage, would greet me, so I called the same day. I found her with her mother, rosary in hand, while her noble father was botching old boots. I laughed inwardly at being obliged to give the title of don to a cobbler who would not make boots because he was an hidalgo. Hidalgo, meaning noble, is derived from \\'higo de albo\\', son of somebody, and the people, whom the nobles call \\'higos de nade\\', sons of nobody, often revenge themselves by calling the nobles hideputas, that is to say, sons of harlots.',\n",
       " 'Donna Ignazia rose politely from the floor, where she was sitting cross– legged, after the Moorish fashion. I have seen exalted ladies in this position at Madrid, and it is very common in the antechambers of the Court and the palace of the Princess of the Asturias. The Spanish women sit in church in the same way, and the rapidity with which they can change this posture to a kneeling or a standing one is something amazing. Donna Ignazia thanked me for honouring her with a visit, adding that she would never have gone to the ball if it had not been for me, and that she never hoped to go to it again, as I had doubtless found someone else more worthy of my attentions. \"I have not found anyone worthy to be preferred before you,\" I replied, \"and if you would like to go to the ball again I should be most happy to take you. \" The father and mother were delighted with the pleasure I was about to give to their beloved daughter.',\n",
       " 'As the ball was to take place the same evening, I gave the mother a doubloon to get a mask and domino. She went on her errand, and, as Don Diego also went out on some business, I found myself alone with the girl. I took the opportunity of telling her that if she willed I would be hers, as I adored her, but that I could not sigh for long. \"What can you ask, and what can I offer, since I must keep myself pure for my husband?\" \"You should abandon yourself to me without reserve, and you may be sure that I should respect your innocence. \" I then proceeded to deliver a gentle attack, which she repulsed, with a serious face. I stopped directly, telling her that she would find me polite and respectful, but not in the least affectionate, for the rest of the evening. Her face had blushed a vivid scarlet, and she replied that her sense of duty obliged her to repulse me in spite of herself. I saw that I had only to destroy the idea of duty in her and all the rest would follow.',\n",
       " 'What I had to do was to enter into an argument, and to bear away the prize directly I saw her at a loss for an answer. \"If your duty,\" I began, \"forces you to repulse me in spite of yourself, your duty is a burden on you. If it is a burden on you, it is your enemy, and if it is your enemy why do you suffer it thus lightly to gain the victory? If you were your own friend, you would at once expel this insolent enemy from your coasts. \" I immediately laid hands on a tender place; she repulsed me, but more gently and not so seriously as before. \"You may, of course, seduce me,\" she said, \"but if you really love me you will spare me the shame. \" \"Dearest Ignazia, there is no shame in a girl giving herself up to the man she loves. \" \"But how shall I convince you that I am actuated by love and not by complaisance?\" \"Leave me to do what I like, and my self–esteem will help me to believe you. \" \"But as I cannot be certain that you will believe me, my duty plainly points to a refusal.',\n",
       " '\" At these encouraging words I embraced her, and obtained some solid favours with one hardy hand. She made no opposition, and I was well pleased with what I had got; and for a first attempt I could not well expect more. At this juncture the mother came in with the dominos and gloves. I refused to accept the change, and went away to return in my carriage, as before. Thus the first step had been taken, and Donna Ignazia felt it would be ridiculous not to join in with my conversation at the ball which all tended to procuring the pleasure of spending our nights together. She found me affectionate all the evening, and at supper I did my best to get her everything she liked. I made her see that the part she had at last taken was worthy of praise, and not blame. I filled her pockets with sweets, and put into my own pockets two bottles of ratafia, which I handed over to the mother, who was asleep in the carriage.',\n",
       " 'Donna Ignazia gratefully refused the quadruple I wished to give her, saying that if it were in my power to make such presents, I might give the money to her lover whenever he called on me. \"Certainly,\" I answered, \"but what shall I say to prevent his taking offence?\" \"Tell him that it is on account of what he asked you. He is poor, and I am sure he is in despair at not seeing me in the window to–night. I shall tell him I only went to the ball with you to please my father. \" Donna Ignazia, a mixture of voluptuousness and piety, like most Spanish women, danced the fandango with so much fire that no words could have expressed so well the Joys that were in store for me. What a dance it is! Her bosom was heaving and her blood all aflame, and yet I was told that for the greater part of the company the dance was wholly innocent, and devoid of any intention. Ignazia begged me to come to mass at the Church of the Soledad the next day at eight o\\'clock.',\n",
       " 'I had not yet told her that it was there I had seen her first. She also asked me to come and see her in the evening, and said she would send me a letter if we were not left alone together. I slept till noon, and was awoke by Marazzini, who came to ask me to give him some dinner. He told me he had seen me with my fair companion the night before, and that he had vainly endeavoured to find out who she was. I bore with this singularly misplaced curiosity, but when it came to his saying that he would have followed us if he had had any money, I spoke to him in a manner that made him turn pale. He begged pardon, and promised to bridle his curiosity for the future. He proposed a party of pleasure with the famous courtezan Spiletta, whose favours were dear, but I declined, for my mind was taken up with the fair Ignazia, whom I considered a worthy successor to Charlotte. I went to the church, and she saw me when she came in, followed by the same companion as before.',\n",
       " 'She knelt down at two or three paces from me, but did not once look in my direction. Her friend, on the other hand, inspected me closely; she seemed about the same age as Ignazia, but she was ugly. I also noticed Don Francisco, and as I was going out of the church my rival followed me, and congratulated me somewhat bitterly on my good fortune in having taken his mistress a second time to the ball. He confessed that he had been on our track the whole evening, and that he should have gone away well enough pleased if it had not been for the way in which we dance the fandango. I felt this was an occasion for a little gentle management, and I answered good–humouredly that the love he thought he noticed was wholly imaginary, and that he was wrong to entertain any suspicions as to so virtuous a girl as Donna Ignazia. At the same time I placed an ounce in his hand, begging him to take it on account.',\n",
       " 'He did so with an astonished stare, and, calling me his father and guardian angel, swore an eternal gratitude. In the evening I called on Don Diego, where I was regaled with the excellent ratafia I had given the mother, and the whole family began to speak of the obligations Spain owed to the Count of Aranda. \"No exercise is more healthful than dancing,\" said Antonia, the mother, \"and before his time balls were strictly forbidden. In spite of that he is hated for having expelled \\'los padres de la compagnia de Jesus\\', and for his sumptuary regulations. But the poor bless his name, for all the money produced by the balls goes to them. \" \"And thus,\" said the father, \"to go to the ball is to do a pious work. \" \"I have two cousins,\" said Ignazia, \"who are perfect angels of goodness. I told them that you had taken me to the ball; but they are so poor that they have no hope of going. If you like you can make them quite happy by taking them on the last day of the carnival.',\n",
       " 'The ball closes at midnight, so as not to profane Ash Wednesday. \" \"I shall be happy to oblige you, all the more as your lady mother will not be obliged to wait for us in the carriage. \" \"You are very kind; but I shall have to introduce you to my aunt; she is so particular. When she knows you, I am sure she will consent, for you have all the air of discretion. Go and see her to–day; she lives in the next street, and over her door you will see a notice that lace is washed within. To–morrow morning, after mass, I will see to everything else, and you must come here at noon to agree as to our meeting on the last day of the carnival. \" I did all this, and the next day I heard that it was settled. \"I will have the dominos ready at my house,\" I said, \"and you must come in at the back door. The eldest of your cousins must be disguised as a man. \" \"I won\\'t tell her anything about that, for fear she might think it a sin, but once in your house you will have no difficulty in managing her.',\n",
       " '\" The younger of the two cousins was ugly, but looked like a woman, where as the elder looked like an ugly dressed man in woman\\'s clothes. She made an amusing contrast with Donna Ignazia, who looked most seductive when she laid aside her air of piety. I took care that everything requisite for our disguises should be at hand in a neighbouring closet, unbeknown to my rascally page. I gave him a piece of money in the morning, and told him to spend the last day of the carnival according to his own taste, as I should not require his services till noon the day after. I ordered a good dinner, and a waiter to serve it, at the tavern, and got rid of Marazzini by giving him a doubloon. I took great pains over the entertainment I was to give the two cousins and the fair Ignazia, whom I hoped that day to make my mistress. It was all quite a novelty for me; I had to do with three devotees, two hideous and the third ravishingly beautiful, who had already had a foretaste of the joys in store for her.',\n",
       " 'They came at noon, and for an hour I discoursed to them in a moral and unctuous manner. I had taken care to provide myself with some excellent wine, which did not fail to take effect on the three girls, who were not accustomed to a dinner that lasted two hours. They were not exactly inebriated, but their spirits were worked up to a pitch they had never attained before. I told the elder cousin, who might be twenty–five years old, that I was going to disguise her as a man; consternation appeared on her features, but I had expected as much, and Donna Ignazia told her she was only too lucky, and her sister observed that she did not think it could be a sin. \"If it were a sin,\" said I, \"do you suppose that I should have suggested it to your virtuous sister. \" Donna Ignazia, who knew the Legendarium by heart, corroborated my assertion by saying that the blessed St. Marina had passed her whole life in man\\'s clothes; and this settled the matter.',\n",
       " 'I then burst into a very high–flown eulogium of her intellectual capacity, so as to enlist her vanity in the good cause. \"Come with me,\" said I, \"and do you ladies wait here; I want to enjoy your surprise when you see her in man\\'s clothes. \" The ugly cousin made a supreme effort and followed me, and when she had duly inspected her disguise I told her to take off her boots and to put on white stockings and shoes, of which I had provided several pairs. I sat down before her, and told her that if she suspected me of any dishonourable intentions she would commit a mortal sin, as I was old enough to be her father. She replied that she was a good Christian, but not a fool. I fastened her garters for her, saying that I should never have supposed she had so well–shapen and so white a leg, which compliment made her smile in a satisfied manner. Although I had a fine view of her thighs, I observed no traces of a blush on her face.',\n",
       " 'I then gave her a pair, of my breeches, which fitted her admirably, though I was five inches taller than she, but this difference was compensated by the posterior proportions, with which, like most women, she was bountifully endowed. I turned away to let her put them on in freedom, and, having given her a linen shirt, she told me she had finished before she had buttoned it at the neck. There may possibly have been a little coquetry in this, as I buttoned the shirt for her, and was thus gratified with a sight of her splendid breast. I need not say whether she was pleased or not at my refraining from complimenting her upon her fine proportions. When her toilette was finished I surveyed her from head to foot, and pronounced her to be a perfect man, with the exception of one blemish. \" \"Will you allow me to arrange your shirt so as to obviate it?\" \"I shall be much obliged, as I have never dressed in man\\'s clothes before.',\n",
       " '\" I then sat down in front of her, and, after unbuttoning the fly, arranged the shirt in a proper manner. In doing so I allowed myself some small liberties, but I toyed with such a serious air that she seemed to take it all as a matter of course. When I had put on her domino and mask I led her forth, and her sister and Donna Ignazia congratulated her on her disguise, saying that anybody would take her for a man. \"Go with him,\" said the elder, \"Don Jaime is as honest a man as you will find in Spain. \" There was really not much to be done to the younger sister, her disguise being simply a mask and domino, but as I wanted to keep Ignazia a long time I made her put on white stockings, change her kerchief, and a dozen other trifles. When she was ready I brought her forth, and Donna Ignazia noticing that she had changed her stockings and kerchief, asked her whether I were as expert at dressing a lady as at turning a lady into a gentleman.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know,\" she replied, \"I did everything for myself. \" Next came the turn of Don Diego\\'s daughter, and as soon as I had her in the closet I did my pleasure on her, she submitting with an air that seemed to say, \"I only give in because I can\\'t resist. \" Wishing to save her honour I withdrew in time, but in the second combat I held her for half an hour to my arms. However, she was naturally of a passionate disposition, and nature had endowed her with a temperament able to resist the most vigorous attacks. When decency made us leave the closet, she remarked to her cousins, \"I thought I should never have done; I had to alter the whole fit of the domino. At nightfall we went to the ball, at which the fandango might be danced ad libitum by a special privilege, but the crowd was so great that dancing was out of the question. At ten we had supper, and then walked up and down, till all at once the two orchestras became silent.',\n",
       " 'We heard the church clocks striking midnight the carnival was over, and Lent had begun. This rapid transition from wantonness to devotion, from paganism to Christianity, has something startling and unnatural about it. At fifty– nine minutes past eleven the senses are all aglow; midnight sounds, and in a minute they are supposed to be brought low, and the heart to be full of humble repentance; it is an absurdity, an impossibility. I took the three girls to my house to take off their dominos, and we then escorted the two cousins home. When we had left them for a few minutes Donna Ignazia told me that she would like a little coffee. I understood her, and took her to my house, feeling sure of two hours of mutual pleasure. I took her to my room, and was just going out to order the coffee when I met Don Francisco, who asked me plainly to let him come up, as he had seen Donna Ignazia go in with me.',\n",
       " \"I had sufficient strength of mind to conceal my rage and disappointment, and told him to come in, adding that his mistress would be delighted at this unexpected visit. I went upstairs, and he followed me, and I shewed him into the room, congratulating the lady on the pleasant surprise. I expected that she would play her part as well as I had played mine, but I was wrong. In her rage she told him that she would never have asked me to give her a cup of coffee if she had foreseen this piece of importunity, adding that if he had been a gentleman he would have known better than to intrude himself at such an hour. In spite of my own anger I felt that I must take the poor devil's part; he looked like a dog with a tin kettle tied to his tail. I tried to calm Donna Ignazia, telling her that Don Francisco had seen us by a mere accident, and that it was I who had asked him to come upstairs, in the hope of pleasing her.\",\n",
       " 'Donna Ignazia feigned to be persuaded and asked her lover to sit down, but she did not speak another word to him, confining her remarks to me, saying how much she had enjoyed the ball, and how kind I had been to take her cousins. After he had taken a cup of coffee, Don Francisco bade us a good night. I told him I hoped he would come and see me before Lent was over, but Donna Ignazia only vouchsafed him a slight nod. When he had gone she said, sadly enough, that she was sorry he had deprived us both of our pleasure, and that she was sure Don Francisco was still hanging about the place, and that she dared not expose herself to his vengeance. \"So take me home, but if you love me come and see me again. The trick the stupid fellow has played me shall cost him dear. Are you sure I don\\'t love him?\" \"Quite certain, for you love me too well to love anybody else.',\n",
       " '\" Donna Ignazia gave me a hasty proof of her affection, and I escorted her home, assuring her that she would be the sole object of my thoughts as long as I stayed at Madrid. The next day I dined with Mengs, and the day after that I was accosted in the street by an ill–looking fellow, who bade me follow him to a cloister, as he had something of importance to communicate to me. As soon as he saw that we were unobserved, he told me that the Alcalde Messa was going to pay me a visit that same night with a band of police, \"of whom,\" he added, \"I am one. He knows, or thinks he knows, certain other things which authorize him to seize your person and to take you to the prison where persons destined for the galleys are kept. I give you all this warning because I believe you to be a man of honour. Despise not my advice, but look to yourself, and get into some place of security.',\n",
       " '\" I credited what he told me, as the circumstance of my having arms was perfectly true, so I gave the man a doubloon, and, instead of calling on Donna Ignazia, as I intended, I went back to my lodging, and after putting the weapons under my cloak I went to Mengs\\'s, leaving word at the cafe to send me my page as soon as he came back. In Mengs\\'s house I was safe, as it belonged to the king. The painter was an honest fellow, but proud and suspicious in excess. He did not refuse me an asylum for the night, but he told me that I must look out for some other refuge, as the alcalde must have some other accusation against me, and that knowing nothing of the merits or demerits of the case he could not take any part in it.',\n",
       " 'He gave me a room and we supped together, discussing the matter all the time, I persisting that the possession of arms was my only offence, and he replying that if it were so I should have awaited the alcalde fearlessly, as it stood to reason that a man had a right to keep defensive weapons in his own room. To this I answered that I had only come to him to avoid passing the night in prison, as I was certain that the man had told me the truth. \" I confessed, however, that it would have been wiser of me to leave my pistols and musket in my room. \" As we were arguing it over my landlord came and said that the alcalde with thirty constables had been to my apartment and had broken open the door. He had searched everything, but unsuccessfully, and had gone away after sealing the room and its contents.',\n",
       " 'He had arrested and imprisoned my page on the charge of having warned me, \"for otherwise,\" he said, \"the Venetian gentleman would never have gone to the house of Chevalier Mengs, where he is out of my power. \" At this Mengs agreed that I had been right in believing my informant\\'s tale, and he added that the first thing in the morning I should go and protest my innocence before the Count of Aranda, but he especially urged on me the duty of defending the poor page. My landlord went his way, and we continued the discussion, Mengs insisting on the page\\'s innocence, till at last I lost all patience, and said,— \"My page must be a thorough–paced scoundrel; the magistrate\\'s arresting him for warning me is an absolute proof that he knew of my approaching arrest. What is a servant who does not warn his master under such circumstances but a rascal? Indeed I am absolutely certain that he was the informer, for he was the only person who knew where the arms were concealed.',\n",
       " '\" Mengs could find no answer to this, and left to go to bed. Early the next morning the great Mengs sent me linen and all the requisites of the toilette. His maid brought me a cup of chocolate, and his cook came to ask if I had permission to eat flesh–meat. In such ways a prince welcomes a guest, and bids him stay, but such behaviour in a private person is equivalent to a hint to go. I expressed my gratitude, and only accepted a cup of chocolate and one handkerchief. My carriage was at the door, and I was just taking leave of Mengs when an officer appeared on the scene, and asked the painter if the Chevalier de Casanova was in his house. \"Then I hope you will follow me of your own free will to the prison of Buen Retiro. I cannot use force here, for this house is the king\\'s, but I warn you that in less than an hour the Chevalier Mengs will have orders to turn you out, and then you will be dragged to prison, which would be unpleasant for you.',\n",
       " 'I therefore advise you to follow me quietly, and to give up such weapons as you may possess. \" \"The Chevalier Mengs will give you the weapons in question. I have carried them with me for eleven years; they are meant to protect me on the highways. I am ready to follow you, but first allow me to write four notes; I shall not be half an hour. \" \"I can neither allow you to wait nor to write, but you will be at liberty to do so after you have reached the prison. \" \"Very good; then I am ready to follow you, for I have no choice. I shall remember Spanish justice!\" I embraced Mengs, had the weapons put into my carriage, and got in with the officer, who seemed a perfect gentleman. He took me to the Castle of Buen Retiro, formerly a royal palace, and now a prison. When my conductor had consigned me to the officer of the watch I was handed over to a corporal, who led me into a vast hall on the ground floor of the building.',\n",
       " 'The stench was dreadful, and the prisoners were about thirty, ten of them being soldiers. There were ten or twelve large beds, some benches, no tables, and no chairs. I asked a guard to get me some pens, ink, and paper, and gave him a duro for the purpose. He took the coin smilingly, and went away, but he did not return. When I asked his brethren what had become of him they laughed in my face. But what surprised me the most was the sight of my page and Marazzini, who told me in Italian that he had been there for three days, and that he had not written to me as he had a presentiment that we should soon meet. He added that in a fortnight\\'s time we should be sent off under a heavy escort to work in some fortress, though we might send our pleas to the Government, and might possibly be let out after three or four years\\' imprisonment. \"I hope,\" he said, \"not to be condemned before I am heard. The alcalde will come and interrogate you tomorrow, and your answers will be taken down; that\\'s all.',\n",
       " '\" \"Has your case been heard yet?\" \"They were at me about it for three hours yesterday. \" \"What kind of questions did they ask you?\" \"They wished to know what banker furnished me with money for my expenses. I told them I had not got a banker, and that I lived by borrowing from my friends, in the expectation of becoming one of the king\\'s body–guard. They then asked me how it was that the Parmese ambassador knew nothing about me, and I replied that I had never been presented to him. \"\\'Without the favour of your ambassador,\\' they objected, \\'you could never join the royal guard, and you must be aware of that, but the king\\'s majesty shall give you employment where you will stand in need of no commendation;\\' and so the alcalde left me. If the Venetian ambassador does not interpose in your behalf you will be treated in the same way. \" I concealed my rage, and sat down on a bed, which I left after three hours, as I found myself covered with the disgusting vermin which seem endemic in Spain.',\n",
       " 'I stood upright, motionless, and silent, devouring the bile which consumed me. There was no good in talking; I must write; but where was I to find writing materials? However, I resolved to wait in silence; my time must come, sooner or later. At noon Marazzini told me that he knew a soldier for whose trustworthiness he would answer, and who would get me my dinner if I gave him the money. \"I have no appetite,\" I replied, \"and I am not going to give a farthing to anyone till the stolen crown is restored to me. \" He made an uproar over this piece of cheating, but the soldiers only laughed at him. My page then asked him to intercede with me, as he was hungry, and had no money wherewith to buy food.',\n",
       " '\"I will not give him a farthing; he is no longer in my service, and would to God I had never seen him!\" My companions in misery proceeded to dine on bad garlic soup and wretched bread, washed down by plain water, two priests and an individual who was styled corregidor excepted, and they seemed to fare very well. At four o\\'clock one of Mengs\\'s servants brought me a dinner which would have sufficed for four. He wanted to leave me the dinner and come for the plates in the evening; but not caring to share the meal with the vile mob around me I made him wait till I had done and come again at the same time the next day, as I did not require any supper. Marazzini said rudely that I might at least have kept the bottle of wine; but I gave him no answer. At five o\\'clock Manucci appeared, accompanied by a Spanish officer.',\n",
       " 'After the usual compliments had passed between us I asked the officer if I might write to my friends, who would not allow me to stay much longer in prison if they were advised of my arrest. \"We are no tyrants,\" he replied; \"you can write what letters you like. \" \"Then,\" said I, \"as this is a free country, is it allowable for a soldier who has received certain moneys to buy certain articles to pocket the money and appropriate it to his own use?\" \"What is his name?\" The guard had been relieved, and no one seemed to know who or where he was. \"I promise you, sir,\" said the officer, \"that the soldier shall be punished and your money restored to you; and in the meanwhile you shall have pens, ink, paper, a table, and a candle, immediately. \" \"And I,\" added Manucci, \"promise you that one of the ambassador\\'s servants shall wait on you at eight o\\'clock to deliver any letters you may write.',\n",
       " '\" I took three crowns from my pocket, and told my fellow–prisoners that the first to name the soldier who had deceived me should have the money; Marazzini was the first to do so. The officer made a note of the man\\'s name with a smile; he was beginning to know me; I had spent three crowns to get back one, and could not be very avaricious. Manucci whispered to me that the ambassador would do his best in a confidential way to get my release, and that he had no doubt of his success. When my visitors were gone I sat down to write, but I had need of all my patience. The rascally prisoners crowded round me to read what I was writing, and when they could not understand it they were impudent enough to ask me to explain it to them. Under the pretext of snuffing the candle, they put it out. One of the soldiers said he would keep them quiet for a crown, but I gave him no answer. In spite of the hell around me, I finished my letters and sealed them up.',\n",
       " 'They were no studied or rhetorical epistles, but merely the expression of the fury with which I was consumed. I told Mocenigo that it was his duty to defend a subject of his prince, who had been arrested and imprisoned by a foreign power on an idle pretext. I shewed him that he must give me his protection unless I was guilty, and that I had committed no offence against the law of the land. I reminded him that I was a Venetian, in spite of my persecution at the hands of the State Inquisitors, and that being a Venetian I had a right to count on his protection. To Don Emmanuel de Roda, a learned scholar, and the minister of justice, I wrote that I did not ask any favour but only simple justice. \"Let his Catholic majesty save me from the hands of the infamous alcalde who has arrested me, an honest and a law–abiding man, who came to Spain trusting in his own innocence and the protection of the laws.',\n",
       " 'The person who writes to you, my lord, has a purse full of doubloons in his pocket; he has already been robbed, and fears assassination in the filthy den in which he has been imprisoned. \" I wrote to the Duke of Lossada, requesting him to inform the king that his servants had subjected to vile treatment a man whose only fault was that he had a little money. I begged him to use his influence with his Catholic majesty to put a stop to these infamous proceedings. But the most vigorous letter of all was the one I addressed to the Count of Aranda. I told him plainly that if this infamous action went on I should be forced to believe that it was by his orders, since I had stated in vain that I came to Madrid with an introduction to him from a princess.',\n",
       " '\"I have committed no crime,\" I said; \"what compensation am I to have when I am released from this filthy and abominable place? Set me at liberty at once, or tell your hangmen to finish their work, for I warn you that no one shall take me to the galleys alive. \" According to my custom I took copies of all the letters, and I sent them off by the servant whom the all–powerful Manucci despatched to the prison. I passed such a night as Dante might have imagined in his Vision of Hell. All the beds were full, and even if there had been a spare place I would not have occupied it. I asked in vain for a mattress, but even if they had brought me one, it would have been of no use, for the whole floor was inundated. There were only two or three chamber utensils for all the prisoners, and everyone discharged his occasions on the floor. I spent the night on a narrow bench without a back, resting my head on my hands.',\n",
       " \"At seven o'clock the next morning Manucci came to see me; I looked upon him as my Providence. I begged him to take me down to the guard–room, and give me some refreshment, for I felt quite exhausted. My request was granted, and as I told my sufferings I had my hair done by a barber. Manucci told me that my letters would be delivered in the course of the day, and observed, smilingly, that my epistle to the ambassador was rather severe. I shewed him copies of the three others I had written, and the inexperienced young man told me that gentleness was the best way to obtain favours. He did not know that there are circumstances in which a man's pen must be dipped in gall. He told me confidentially that the ambassador dined with Aranda that day, and would speak in my favour as a private individual, adding that he was afraid my letter would prejudice the proud Spaniard against me.\",\n",
       " '\"All I ask of you,\" said I, \"is not to tell the ambassador that you have seen the letter I wrote to the Count of Aranda. An hour after his departure I saw Donna Ignazia and her father coming in, accompanied by the officer who had treated me with such consideration. Their visit cut me to the quick; nevertheless, I felt grateful, for it shewed me the \\'goodness of Don Diego\\'s heart and the love of the fair devotee. I gave them to understand, in my bad Spanish, that I was grateful for the honour they had done me in visiting me in this dreadful situation. Donna Ignazia did not speak, she only wept in silence; but Don Diego gave me clearly to understand that he would never have come to see me unless he had felt certain that my accusation was a mistake or an infamous calumny. He told me he was sure I should be set free, and that proper satisfaction would be given me. \"I hope so,\" I replied, \"for I am perfectly innocent of any offence.',\n",
       " '\" I was greatly touched when the worthy man slipped into my hands a rouleau, telling me it contained twelve quadruples, which I could repay at my convenience. It was more than a thousand francs, and my hair stood on end. I pressed his hand warmly, and whispered to him that I had fifty in my pocket, which I was afraid to shew him, for fear the rascals around might rob me. He put back his rouleau, and bade me farewell in tears, and I promised to come and see him as soon as I should be set at liberty. He had not sent in his name, and as he was very well dressed he was taken for a man of importance. Such characters are not altogether exceptional in heroic Spain; it is a land of extremes. At noon Mengs\\'s servant came with a dinner that was choicer than before, but not so plentiful. He waited for me to finish, and went away with the plates, carrying my heartiest thanks to his master. At one o\\'clock an individual came up to me and bade me follow him.',\n",
       " 'He took me to a small room, where I saw my carbine and pistols. In front of me was the Alcalde Messa, seated at a table covered with documents, and a policeman stood on each side of him. The alcalde told me to sit down, and to answer truly such questions as might be put to me, warning me that my replies would be taken down. \"I do not understand Spanish well, and I shall only give written answers to any questions that may be asked of me, in Italian, French, or Latin. \" This reply, which I uttered in a firm and determined voice, seemed to astonish him. He spoke to me for an hour, and I understood him very well, but he only got one reply: \"I don\\'t understand what you say. Get a judge who understands one of the languages I have named, and I will write down my answers. \" The alcalde was enraged, but I did not let his ill–humour or his threats disturb me. Finally he gave me a pen, and told me to write my name, profession, and business in Spain in Italian.',\n",
       " 'I could not refuse him this pleasure, so I wrote as follows: \"My name is Jacques Casanova; I am a subject of the Republic of Venice, by profession a man of letters, and in rank a Knight of the Golden Spur. I have sufficient means, and I travel for my pleasure. I am known to the Venetian ambassador, the Count of Aranda, the Prince de la Catolica, the Marquis of Moras, and the Duke of Lossada. I have offended in no manner against the laws of his Catholic majesty, but in spite of my innocence I have been cast into a den of thieves and assassins by magistrates who deserve a ten times greater punishment. Since I have not infringed the laws, his Catholic majesty must know that he has only one right over me, and that is to order me to leave his realms, which order I am ready to obey. My arms, which I see before me, have travelled with me for the last eleven years; I carry them to defend myself against highwaymen.',\n",
       " 'They were seen when my effects were examined at the Gate of Alcala, and were not confiscated; which makes it plain that they have served merely as a pretext for the infamous treatment to which I have been subjected. \" After I had written out this document I gave it to the alcalde, who called for an interpreter. When he had had it read to him he rose angrily and said to me,— \"Valga me Dios! You shall suffer for your insolence. \" With this threat he went away, ordering that I should be taken back to prison. At eight o\\'clock Manucci called and told me that the Count of Aranda had been making enquiries about me of the Venetian ambassador, who had spoken very highly in my favour, and expressed his regret that he could not take my part officially on account of my being in disgrace with the State Inquisitors. \"He has certainly been shamefully used,\" said the count, \"but an intelligent man should not lose his head.',\n",
       " 'I should have known nothing about it, but for a furious letter he has written me; and Don Emmanuel de Roda and the Duke of Lossada have received epistles in the same style. Casanova is in the right, but that is not the way to address people. \" \"If he really said I was in the right, that is sufficient. \" \"Then he must do me justice, and as to my style everyone has a style of their own. Look at this place; I have no bed, the floor is covered with filth, and I am obliged to sleep on a narrow bench. Don\\'t you think it is natural that I should desire to eat the hearts of the scoundrels who have placed me here? If I do not leave this hell by tomorrow, I shall kill myself, or go mad. He promised to come again early the next day, and advised me to see what money would do towards procuring a bed, but I would not listen to him, for I was suffering from injustice, and was therefore obstinate.',\n",
       " 'Besides, the thought of the vermin frightened me, and I was afraid for my purse and the jewels I had about me. I spent a second night worse than the first, going to sleep from sheer exhaustion, only to awake and find myself slipping off the bench. Manucci came before eight o\\'clock, and my aspect shocked him. He had come in his carriage, bringing with him some excellent chocolate, which in some way restored my spirits. As I was finishing it, an officer of high rank, accompanied by two other officers, came in and called out,— \"M. de Casanova!\" I stepped forward and presented myself. \"Chevalier,\" he began, \"the Count of Aranda is at the gate of the prison; he is much grieved at the treatment you have received. He only heard about it through the letter you wrote him yesterday, and if you had written sooner your pains would have been shorter.',\n",
       " '\" I proceeded to tell him the story of the swindling soldier, and on hearing his name the colonel called the captain of the guard, reprimanded him severely, and ordered him to give me back the crown himself. I took the money laughingly, and the colonel then ordered the captain to fetch the offending soldier, and to give him a flogging before me. This officer, the emissary of the all–powerful Aranda, was Count Royas, commanding the garrison of Buen Retiro. I told him all the circumstances of my arrest, and of my imprisonment in that filthy place. I told him that if I did not get back that day my arms, my liberty, and my honour, I should either go mad or kill myself. \"Here,\" I said, \"I can neither rest nor sleep, and a man needs sleep every night. If you had come a little earlier you would have seen the disgusting filth with which the floor was covered. \" The worthy man was taken aback with the energy with which I spoke.',\n",
       " 'I saw his feelings, and hastened to say,— \"You must remember, colonel, that I am suffering from injustice, and am in a furious rage. I am a man of honour, like yourself, and you can imagine the effect of such treatment on me. \" Manucci told him, in Spanish, that in my normal state I was a good fellow enough. The colonel expressed his pity for me, and assured me that my arms should be restored to me, and my liberty too, in the course of the day. \"Afterwards,\" said he, \"you must go and thank his excellency the Count of Aranda, who came here expressly for your sake. He bade me tell you that your release would be delayed till the afternoon, that you may have full satisfaction for the affront you have received, if it is an affront, for the penalties of the law only dishonour the guilty. In this instance the Alcalde Messa has been deceived by the rascal who was in your service. \"Be good enough to have him removed, or else, in my indignation, I might kill him.',\n",
       " 'The colonel went out, and two minutes later two soldiers came in and took the rogue away between them. I never saw him again, and never troubled myself to enquire what had become of him. The colonel begged me to accompany him to the guard–room, to see the thieving soldier flogged. Manucci was at my side, and at some little distance stood the Count of Aranda, surrounded by officers, and accompanied by a royal guard. Before leaving me the colonel begged me to meet Mengs at dinner at his house. When I returned to my filthy prison I found a clean arm–chair, which I was informed had been brought in for me. I sat down in it immediately, and Manucci left me, after embracing me again and again. He was my sincere friend, and I can never forgive myself the stupidity which made me offend him grievously. He never forgave me, at which I am not surprised, but I believe my readers will agree with me in thinking that he carried his vengeance too far.',\n",
       " 'After the scene which had taken place, the vile crowd of prisoners stood gazing at me in stupid silence, and Marazzini came up to me and begged me to use my offices for him. Dinner was brought me as usual, and at three o\\'clock the Alcalde Messa appeared and begged me to follow him, as he had received orders to take me back to my lodging, where he hoped I should find everything in perfect order. At the same time he shewed me my arms, which one of his men was going to bring to my house. The officer of the guard returned me my sword, the alcalde, who was in his black cloak, put himself on my left hand, and thus I was escorted home with a guard of thirty constables. The seals were removed from my apartment, and after a brief inspection I pronounced that everything was in perfect order. \"If you had not a rascal and a traitor (who shall end his days in the galleys) in your service, Senor Caballero, you would never have written down the servants of his Catholic majesty as scoundrels.',\n",
       " '\" \"Senor Alcalde, my indignation made me write the same sentence to four of his majesty\\'s ministers. Then I believed what I wrote, but I do so no longer. Let us forget and forgive; but you must confess that if I had not known how to write a letter you would have sent me to the galleys. \" I need not say that I hastened to remove all traces of the vile prison where I had suffered so much. When I was ready to go out my first grateful visit was paid to the noble cobbler. The worthy man was proud of the fulfilment of his prophecy, and glad to see me again. Donna Ignazia was wild with delight—perhaps she had not been so sure of my release—and when Don Diego heard of the satisfaction that had been given me he said that a grandee of Spain could not have asked for more. I begged the worthy people to come and dine with me, telling them that I would name the day another time, and they accepted gladly. I felt that my love for Donna Ignazia had increased immensely since our last meeting.',\n",
       " 'Afterwards I called on Mengs, who with his knowledge of Spanish law expected nothing less than to see me. When he heard of my triumphant release he overwhelmed me with congratulations. He was in his Court dress—an unusual thing with him, and on my asking him the reason he told me that he had been to Don Emmanuel de Roda\\'s to speak on my behalf, but had not succeeded in obtaining an audience. He gave me a Venetian letter which had just arrived for me. Dandolo said that on reading the enclosed letter the ambassador would have no more scruples about introducing me, as it contained a recommendation from one of the Inquisitors on behalf of the three. When I told Mengs of this he said it was now in my power to make my fortune in Spain, and that now was the time when all the ministers would be only too anxious to do something for me to make me forget the wrongs I had received. \"I advise you,\" he said, \"to take the letter to the ambassador immediately.',\n",
       " 'Take my carriage; after what you have undergone for the last few days you cannot be in a walking humour. \" I had need of rest, and told Mengs that I would not sup with him that night, but would dine with him the next day. The ambassador was out, so I left the letter with Manucci, and then drove home and slept profoundly for twelve hours. Manucci came to see me the next day in high spirits, and told me that M. Girolamo Zulian had written to the ambassador on behalf of M. du Mula, informing him that he need not hesitate to countenance me, as any articles the Tribunal might have against me were in no degree prejudicial to my honour. \"The ambassador,\" he continued, \"proposes to introduce you at Court next week, and he wants you to dine with him to–day; there will be a numerous company at dinner. \" \"No matter, he shall be asked as well; you must come. Consider the effect of your presence at the ambassador\\'s the day after your triumph.',\n",
       " 'Go and ask Mengs, and tell the ambassador that I have much pleasure in accepting his invitation.',\n",
       " \"Chapter V Campomanes--olavides--sierra Morena--aranjuez--mengs--the Marquis Grimaldi--toledo--madame Pelliccia--my Return to Madrid Different circumstances in my life seem to have combined to render me somewhat superstitious; it is a humiliating confession, and yet I make it. But who could help it? A man who abandons himself to his whims and fancies is like a child playing with a billiard cue. It may make a stroke that would be an honour to the most practised and scientific player; and such are the strange coincidences of life which, as I have said, have caused me to become superstitious. Fortune, which under the humbler name of luck seems but a word, is a very divinity when it guides the most important actions of a man's life. Always it has seemed to me that this divinity is not blind, as the mythologists affirm; she had brought me low only to exalt me, and I found myself in high places, only, as it seems, to be cast into the depths.\",\n",
       " 'Fortune has done her best to make me regard her as a reasoning, almighty power; she has made me feel that the strength of my will is as nothing before this mysterious power, which takes my will and moulds it, and makes it a mere instrument for the accomplishment of its decrees. I could not possibly have done anything in Spain without the help of the representative of my country, and he would not have dared to do anything for me without the letter I had just given him. This letter, in its turn, would probably have had but slight effect if it had not come to hand so soon after my imprisonment, which had become the talk of the town, through the handsome satisfaction the Count of Aranda had given me. The letter made the ambassador sorry that he had not interposed on my behalf, but he hoped people would believe that the count would not have acted as he did if it had not been for his interposition.',\n",
       " 'His favourite, Count Manucci, had come to ask me to dinner; as it happened I was engaged to Mengs, which obtained an invitation for the painter, and flattered his vanity excessively. He fancied that the invitation proceeded from gratitude, and it certainly smoothed away the mortification he had felt at seeing me arrested in his house. He immediately wrote to the effect that he would call upon me with his carriage. I called on the Count of Aranda, who kept me waiting for a quarter of an hour, and then came in with some papers in his hand. He smiled when he saw me, and said,— \"Your business is done. Stay, here are four letters; take them and read them over again. \" \"Why should I read them again? This is the document I gave the alcalde. Read, and confess that you should not have written so violently, in spite of the wrongs that vexed you. \" \"I crave your pardon, my lord, but a man who meditates suicide does not pick terms. I believed that your excellency was at the bottom of it all.',\n",
       " 'Go and thank Don Emmanuel de Roda, who wants to know you, and I shall be glad if you will call once on the alcalde, not to make him an apology, for you owe him none, but as an act of politeness to salve over the hard things you said of him. If you write the history of Princess Lubomirska, I hope you will tell her that I did my best for you. \" I then called on Colonel Royas, who told me that I had made a great mistake in saying that I was satisfied. Dismissal of the alcalde and compensation to the tune of fifty thousand duros. Spain is a country where a man may speak out save in the matters which the Holy Inquisition looks after. \" This colonel, now a general, is one of the pleasantest Spaniards I have ever met. I had not long returned to my lodging when Mengs called for me in his carriage. The ambassador gave me a most gracious reception, and overwhelmed Mengs with compliments for having endeavoured to shelter me.',\n",
       " \"At dinner I told the story of my sufferings at Buen Retiro, and the conversation I had just had with the Count of Aranda, who had returned me my letters. The company expressed a desire to see them, and everyone gave an opinion on the matter. The guests were Abbe Bigliardi, the French consul, Don Rodrigues de Campomanes, and the famous Don Pablo d'Olavides. Everyone spoke his mind, and the ambassador condemned the letters as too ferocious. On the other hand, Campomanes approved them, saying that they were not abusive, and were wonderfully adapted to my purpose, namely, to force the reader to do me prompt justice, were the reader to be the king himself. Mengs sided with the ambassador, and begged me to come and live with him, so as not to be liable to any more inconveniences from spying servants. I did not accept this invitation till I had been pressed for some time, and I noted the remark of the ambassador, who said I owed Mengs this reparation for the indirect affront he had received.\",\n",
       " \"I was delighted to make the acquaintance of Campomanes and Olavides, men of intellect and of a stamp very rare in Spain. They were not exactly men of learning, but they were above religious prejudices, and were not only fearless in throwing public scorn upon them but even laboured openly for their destruction. It was Campomanes who had furnished Aranda with all the damaging matter against the Jesuits. By a curious coincidence, Campomanes, the Count of Aranda, and the General of the Jesuits, were all squint–eyed. I asked Campomanes why he hated the Jesuits so bitterly, and he replied that he looked upon them in the same light as the other religious orders, whom he considered a parasitical and noxious race, and would gladly banish them all, not only from the peninsula but from the face of the earth. He was the author of all the pamphlets that had been written on the subject of mortmain; and as he was an intimate friend of the ambassador's, M.\",\n",
       " \"Mocenigo had furnished him with an account of the proceedings of the Venetian Republic against the monks. He might have dispensed with this source of information if he had read the writings of Father Paul Sarpi on the same subject. Quick–sighted, firm, with the courage of his opinions, Campomanes was the fiscal of the Supreme Council of Castille, of which Aranda was president. Everyone knew him to be a thoroughly honest man, who acted solely for the good of the State. Thus statesmen and officials had warm feelings of respect for him, while the monks and bigots hated the sound of his name, and the Inquisition had sworn to be his ruin. It was said openly that he would either become a bishop or perish in the cells of the holy brotherhood. Four years after my visit to Spain he was incarcerated in the dungeons of the Inquisition, but he obtained his release after three years' confinement by doing public penance. The leprosy which eats out the heart of Spain is not yet cured.\",\n",
       " 'Olavides was still more harshly treated, and even Aranda would have fallen a victim if he had not had the good sense to ask the king to send him to France as his ambassador. The king was very glad to do so, as otherwise he would have been forced to deliver him up to the infuriated monks. He was as obstinate as a mule, as weak as a woman, as gross as a Dutchman, and a thorough–paced bigot. It was no wonder that he became the tool of his confessor. At the time of which I am speaking the cabinet of Madrid was occupied in a curious scheme. A thousand Catholic families had been enticed from Switzerland to form a colony in the beautiful but deserted region called the Sierra Morena, well known all over Europe by its mention in Don Quixote. Nature seemed there to have lavished all her gifts; the climate was perfect, the soil fertile, and streams of all kinds watered the land, but in spite of all it was almost depopulated.',\n",
       " 'Desiring to change this state of things, his Catholic majesty had decided to make a present of all the agricultural products for a certain number of years to industrious colonists. He had consequently invited the Swiss Catholics, and had paid their expenses for the journey. The Swiss arrived, and the Spanish government did its best to provide them with lodging and spiritual and temporal superintendence. He conferred with the ministers to provide the new population with magistrates, priests, a governor, craftsmen of all kinds to build churches and houses, and especially a bull–ring, a necessity for the Spaniards, but a perfectly useless provision as far as the simple Swiss were concerned.',\n",
       " 'In the documents which Don Pablo Olavides had composed on the subject he demonstrated the inexpediency of establishing any religious orders in the new colony, but if he could have proved his opinion to be correct with foot and rule he would none the less have drawn on his head the implacable hatred of the monks, and of the bishop in whose diocese the new colony was situated. The secular clergy supported Olavides, but the monks cried out against his impiety, and as the Inquisition was eminently monkish in its sympathies persecution had already begun, and this was one of the subjects of conversation at the dinner at which I was present. I listened to the arguments, sensible and otherwise, which were advanced, and I finally gave my opinion, as modestly as I could, that in a few years the colony would banish like smoke; and this for several reasons.',\n",
       " '\"The Swiss,\" I said, \"are a very peculiar people; if you transplant them to a foreign shore, they languish and die; they become a prey to home– sickness. When this once begins in a Switzer, the only thing is to take him home to the mountain, the lake, or the valley, where he was born, or else he will infallibly die. \" \"It would be wise, I think,\" I continued, \"to endeavour to combine a Spanish colony with the Swiss colony, so as to effect a mingling of races. At first, at all events, their rules, both spiritual and temporal, should be Swiss, and, above all, you would have to insure them complete immunity from the Inquisition. The Swiss who has been bred in the country has peculiar customs and manners of love–making, of which the Spanish Church might not exactly approve; but the least attempt to restrain their liberty in this respect would immediately bring about a general home–sickness.',\n",
       " '\" At first Olavides thought I was joking, but he soon found out that my remarks had some sense in them. He begged me to write out my opinions on the subject, and to give him the benefit of my knowledge. I promised to do so, and Mengs fixed a day for him to come and dine with me at his house. The next day I moved my household goods to Mengs\\'s house, and began my philosophical and physiological treatise on the colony. I called on Don Emmanuel de Roda, who was a man of letters, a \\'rara aves\\' in Spain. He liked Latin poetry, had read some Italian, but very naturally gave the palm to the Spanish poets. He welcomed me warmly, begged me to come and see him again, and told me how sorry he had been at my unjust imprisonment. The Duke of Lossada congratulated me on the way in which the Venetian ambassador spoke of me everywhere, and encouraged me in my idea of getting some place under Government, promising to give me his support in the matter.',\n",
       " \"The Prince della Catolica, invited me to dinner with the Venetian ambassador; and in the course of three weeks I had made a great number of valuable acquaintances. I thought seriously of seeking employment in Spain, as not having heard from Lisbon I dared not go there on the chance of finding something to do. I had not received any letters from Pauline of late, and had no idea as to what had become of her. I passed a good many of my evenings with a Spanish lady, named Sabatini, who gave 'tertullas' or assemblies, frequented chiefly by fifth–rate literary men. I also visited the Duke of Medina–Sidonia, a well–read and intelligent man, to whom I had been presented by Don Domingo Varnier, one of the gentlemen of the king's chamber, whom I had met at Mengs's house. I paid a good many visits to Donna Ignazia, but as I was never left alone with her these visits became tiresome.\",\n",
       " 'When I suggested a party of pleasure with her and her cousins, she replied that she would like it as much as I, but as it was Lent and near Holy Week, in which God died for our salvation, it was more fit to think of penance than pleasure. After Easter, she said, we might consider the matter. Ignazia was a perfect example of the young Spanish devotee. A fortnight after, the King and Court left Madrid for Aranjuez. de Mocenigo asked me to come and stay with him, as he would be able to present me at Court. As may be imagined, I should have been only too glad to accept, but on the eve of my departure, as I was driving with Mengs, I was suddenly seized with a fever, and was convulsed so violently that my head was dashed against the carriage window, which it shivered to fragments. Mengs ordered the coachman to drive home, and I was put to bed. In four hours I was seized with a sweating fit, which lasted for ten or twelve hours.',\n",
       " \"The bed and two mattresses were soaked through with my perspiration, which dripped on to the floor beneath. The fever abated in forty–eight hours, but left me in such a state of weakness that I was kept to my bed for a whole week, and could not go to Aranjuez till Holy Saturday. The ambassador welcomed me warmly, but on the night I arrived a small lump which I had felt in the course of the day grew as large as an egg, and I was unable to go to mass on Easter Day. In five days the excrescence became as large as an average melon, much to the amazement of Manucci and the ambassador, and even of the king's surgeon, a Frenchman who declared he had never seen the like before. I was not alarmed personally, for, as I suffered no pain and the lump was quite soft, I guessed it was only a collection of lymph, the remainder of the evil humours which I had sweated away in the fever.\",\n",
       " 'I told the surgeon the history of the fever and begged him to lance the abscess, which he did, and for four days the opening discharged an almost incredible amount of matter. On the fifth day the wound was almost healed, but the exhaustion had left me so weak that I could not leave my bed. Such was my situation when I received a letter from Mengs. It is before me at the present moment, and I give below a true copy: \"Yesterday the rector of the parish in which I reside affixed to the church–door a list of those of his parishioners who are Atheists and have neglected their Easter duties. Amongst them your name figures in full, and the aforesaid rector has reproached me bitterly for harbouring a heretic. I did not know what answer to make, for I feel sure that you could have stopped in Madrid a day longer to discharge the duties of a Christian, even if it were only out of regard for me.',\n",
       " 'The duty I owe to the king, my master, the care I am bound to take of my reputation, and my fears of being molested, all make me request you to look upon my house as yours no longer. When you return to Madrid you may go where you will, and my servants shall transport your effects to your new abode. \" I was so annoyed by this rude, brutal, and ungrateful letter, that if I had not been seven leagues from Madrid, and in a state of the utmost weakness, Mengs should have suffered for his insolence. I told the messenger who had brought it to begone, but he replied that he had orders to await my reply. I crushed the letter in my hand and flung it at his face, saying,— \"Go and tell your unworthy master what I did with his letter, and tell him that is the only answer that such a letter deserves. \" The innocent messenger went his way in great amazement.',\n",
       " \"My anger gave me strength, and having dressed myself and summoned a sedan–chair I went to church, and was confessed by a Grey Friar, and at six o'clock the next morning I received the Sacrament. My confessor was kind enough to give me a certificate to the effect that I had been obliged to keep my bed since my arrival 'al sitio', and that in spite of my extreme weakness I had gone to church, and had confessed and communicated like a good Christian. He also told me the name of the priest who had affixed the paper containing my name to the door of the church. When I returned to the ambassador's house I wrote to this priest, telling him that the certificate enclosed would inform him as to my reasons for not communicating. I expressed a hope that, being satisfied of my orthodoxy, he would not delay in removing my name from his church– doors, and I concluded by begging him to hand the enclosed letter to the Chevalier Mengs.\",\n",
       " 'To the painter I wrote that I felt that I had deserved the shameful insult he had given me by my great mistake in acceding to his request to honour him by staying in his house. However, as a good Christian who had just received the Holy Communion, I told him that his brutal behaviour was forgiven; but I bade him to take to heart the line, well known to all honest people, and doubtless unknown to him: \\'Turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur hospes. \\' After sending the letter I told the ambassador what had happened, to which he replied,— \"I am not at all surprised at what you tell me. Mengs is only liked for his talents in painting; in everything else he is well known to be little better than a fool. \" As a matter of fact he had only asked me to stay with him to gratify his own vanity.',\n",
       " 'He knew that all the town was talking of my imprisonment and of the satisfaction the Count of Aranda had accorded me, and he wanted people to think that his influence had obtained the favour that had been shewn me. Indeed, he had said in a moment of exaltation that I should have compelled the Alcade Messa to escort me not to my own house but to his, as it was in his house that I had been arrested. Mengs was an exceedingly ambitious and a very jealous man; he hated all his brother painters. His colour and design were excellent, but his invention was very weak, and invention is as necessary to a great painter as a great poet. I happened to say to him one day, \"Just as every poet should be a painter, so every painter should be a poet;\" and he got quite angry, thinking that I was alluding to his weakness of imagination, which he felt but would not acknowledge.',\n",
       " 'He was an ignorant man, and liked to pass for a scholar; he sacrificed to Bacchus and Comus, and would fain be thought sober; he was lustful, bad–tempered, envious, and miserly, but yet would be considered a virtuous man. He loved hard work, and this forced him to abstain, as a rule, from dinner, as he drank so inordinately at that meal that he could do nothing after it. When he dined out he had to drink nothing but water, so as not to compromise his reputation for temperance. He spoke four languages, and all badly, and could not even write his native tongue with correctness; and yet he claimed perfection for his grammar and orthography, as for all his other qualities. While I was staying with him I became acquainted with some of his weak points, and endeavoured to correct them, at which he took great offence. The fellow writhed under a sense of obligation to me.',\n",
       " \"Once I prevented his sending a petition to the Court, which the king would have seen, and which would have made Mengs ridiculous. In signing his name he had written 'el mas inclito', wishing to say your most humble. I pointed out to him that 'el mas inclito' meant the most illustrious, and that the Spanish for the expression he wanted was 'el mas humilde'. The proud fool was quite enraged, telling me that he knew Spanish better than I, but when the dictionary was searched he had to swallow the bitter pill of confessing himself in the wrong. Another time I suppressed a heavy and stupid criticism of his on someone who had maintained that there were no monuments still existing of the antediluvian period. Mengs thought he would confound the author by citing the remains of the Tower of Babel—a double piece of folly, for in the first place there are no such remains, and in the second, the Tower of Babel was a post–diluvian building.\",\n",
       " 'He was also largely given to the discussion of metaphysical questions, on which his knowledge was simply nil, and a favourite pursuit of his was defining beauty in the abstract, and when he was on this topic the nonsense he talked was something dreadful. Mengs was a very passionate man, and would sometimes beat his children most cruelly. More than once I have rescued his poor sons from his furious hands. He boasted that his father, a bad Bohemian artist, had brought him up with the stick. Thus, he said, he had become a great painter, and he wished his own children to enjoy the same advantages. He was deeply offended when he received a letter, of which the address omitted his title of chevalier, and his name, Rafael. One day I ventured to say that these things were but trifles after all, and that I had taken no offence at his omitting the chevalier on the letters he had written to me, though I was a knight of the same order as himself.',\n",
       " 'He very wisely made no answer; but his objection to the omission of his baptismal name was a very ridiculous one. He said he was called Antonio after Antonio Correggio, and Rafael after Rafael da Urbino, and that those who omitted these names, or either of them, implicitly denied his possession of the qualities of both these great painters. Once I dared to tell him that he had made a mistake in the hand of one of his figures, as the ring finger was shorter than the index. He replied sharply that it was quite right, and shewed me his hand by way of proof. I laughed, and shewed him my hand in return, saying that I was certain that my hand was made like that of all the descendants of Adam. \"Then whom do you think that I am descended from?\" \"I don\\'t know, but you are certainly not of the same species as myself. \" \"You mean you are not of my species; all well–made hands of men, and women too, are like mine and not like yours. \" \"I\\'ll wager a hundred doubloons that you are in the wrong.',\n",
       " '\" He got up, threw down brushes and palette, and rang up his servants, saying,— \"We shall see which is right. \" The servants came, and on examination he found that I was right. For once in his life, he laughed and passed it off as a joke, saying,— \"I am delighted that I can boast of being unique in one particular, at all events. \" Here I must note another very sensible remark of his. He had painted a Magdalen, which was really wonderfully beautiful. For ten days he had said every morning, \"The picture will be finished to– night. \" At last I told him that he had made a mistake in saying it would be finished, as he was still working on it. \"No, I have not,\" he replied, \"ninety–nine connoisseurs out of a hundred would have pronounced it finished long ago, but I want the praise of the hundredth man.',\n",
       " 'There\\'s not a picture in the world that can be called finished save in a relative sense; this Magdalen will not be finished till I stop working at it, and then it will be only finished relatively, for if I were to give another day\\'s work to it it would be more finished still. Not one of Petrarch\\'s sonnets is a really finished production; no, nor any other man\\'s sonnets. Nothing that the mind of man can conceive is perfect, save it be a mathematical theorem. \" I expressed my warm approval of the excellent way in which he had spoken. He was not so sensible another time when he expressed a wish to have been Raphael. \" \"Certainly,\" said I, \"but what can you mean by wishing you had been Raphael? This is not sense; if you had been Raphael, you would no longer be existing. But perhaps you only meant to express a wish that you were tasting the joys of Paradise; in that case I will say no more.',\n",
       " '\" \"No, no; I mean I would have liked to have been Raphael without troubling myself about existing now, either in soul or body. \" \"Really such a desire is an absurdity; think it over, and you will see it for yourself. \" He flew into a rage, and abused me so heartily that I could not help laughing. Another time he made a comparison between a tragic author and a painter, of course to the advantage of the latter. I analysed the matter calmly, shewing him that the painter\\'s labour is to a great extent purely mechanical, and can be done whilst engaged in casual talk; whilst a well–written tragedy is the work of genius pure and simple. Therefore, the poet must be immeasurably superior to the painter. \"Find me if you can,\" said I, \"a poet who can order his supper between the lines of his tragedy, or discuss the weather whilst he is composing epic verses. \" When Mengs was beaten in an argument, instead of acknowledging his defeat, he invariably became brutal and insulting.',\n",
       " 'He died at the age of fifty, and is regarded by posterity as a Stoic philosopher, a scholar, and a compendium of all the virtues; and this opinion must be ascribed to a fine biography of him in royal quarto, choicely printed, and dedicated to the King of Spain. Mengs was a great painter, and nothing else; and if he had only produced the splendid picture which hangs over the high altar of the chapel royal at Dresden, he would deserve eternal fame, though indeed he is indebted to the great Raphael for the idea of the painting. We shall hear more of Mengs when I describe my meeting with him at Rome, two or three years later. I was still weak and confined to my room when Manucci came to me, and proposed that I should go with him to Toledo. \"The ambassador,\" he said, \"is going to give a grand official dinner to the ambassadors of the other powers, and as I have not been presented at Court I am excluded from being present. However, if I travel, my absence will not give rise to any remarks.',\n",
       " '\" I was delighted to have the chance of seeing Toledo, and of making the journey in a comfortable carriage, so I accepted. We started the next morning, and reached Toledo in the evening of the same day. For Spain we were lodged comfortably enough, and the next day we went out under the charge of a cicerone, who took us to the Alcazar, the Louvre of Toledo, formerly the palace of the Moorish kings. Afterwards we inspected the cathedral, which is well worthy of a visit, on account of the riches it contains. It is made of silver, and is so heavy that it requires thirty strong men to lift it. The Archbishop of Toledo has three hundred thousand duros a year, and his clergy have four hundred thousand, amounting to two million francs in French money. One of the canons, as he was shewing me the urns containing the relics, told me that one of them contained the thirty pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed our Lord.',\n",
       " 'I begged him to let me see them, to which he replied severely that the king himself would not have dared to express such indecent curiosity. I hastened to apologise, begging him not to take offence at a stranger\\'s heedless questions; and this seemed to calm his anger. The Spanish priests are a band of knaves, but one has to treat them with more respect than one would pay to honest men elsewhere. The following day we were shewn the museum of natural history. It was rather a dull exhibition; but, at all events, one could laugh at it without exciting the wrath of the monks and the terrors of the Inquisition. We were shewn, amongst other wonders, a stuffed dragon, and the man who exhibited it said,— \"This proves, gentlemen, that the dragon is not a fabulous animal;\" but I thought there was more of art than nature about the beast. He then shewed us a basilisk, but instead of slaying us with a glance it only made us laugh.',\n",
       " 'The greatest wonder of all, however, was nothing else than a Freemason\\'s apron, which, as the curator very sagely declared, proved the existence of such an order, whatever some might say. The journey restored me to health, and when I returned to Aranjuez, I proceeded to pay my court to all the ministers. The ambassador presented me to Marquis Grimaldi, with whom I had some conversations on the subject of the Swiss colony, which was going on badly. I reiterated my opinion that the colony should be composed of Spaniards. \"Yes,\" said he, \"but Spain is thinly peopled everywhere, and your plan would amount to impoverishing one district to make another rich. \" \"Not at all, for if you took ten persons who are dying of poverty in the Asturias, and placed them in the Sierra Morena, they would not die till they had begotten fifty children. \" My scheme was laid before a commission, and the marquis promised that I should be made governor of the colony if the plan was accepted.',\n",
       " 'An Italian Opera Comique was then amusing the Court, with the exception of the king, who had no taste for music. His majesty bore a considerable resemblance to a sheep in the face, and it seemed as if the likeness went deeper, for sheep have not the slightest idea of sound. His favourite pursuit was sport, and the reason will be given later on. An Italian musician at the Court desired to compose some music for a new opera, and as there was no time to send to Italy I offered to compose the libretto. My offer was accepted, and by the next day the first act was ready. The music was composed in four days, and the Venetian ambassador invited all the ministers to the rehearsal in the grand hall of his palace. The music was pronounced exquisite; the two other acts were written, and in a fortnight the opera was put upon the stage. The musician was rewarded handsomely, but I was considered too grand to work for money and my reward was paid me in the Court money of compliments.',\n",
       " \"However, I was glad to see that the ambassador was proud of me and that the minister's esteem for me seemed increased. In writing the libretto I had become acquainted with the actresses. The chief of them was a Roman named Pelliccia, neither pretty nor ugly, with a slight squint, and but moderate talents. Her younger sister was pretty if not handsome; but no one cared for the younger, while the elder was a universal favourite. Her expression was pleasant, her smile delightful, and her manners most captivating. Her husband was an indifferent painter, plain–looking, and more like her servant than her husband. He was indeed her very humble servant, and she treated him with great kindness. The feelings she inspired me with were not love, but a sincere respect and friendship. I used to visit her every day, and wrote verses for her to sing to the Roman airs she delivered so gracefully. On one of the days of rehearsals I was pointing out to her the various great personages who were present.\",\n",
       " 'The manager of the company, Marescalchi by name, had entered into an arrangement with the Governor of Valentia to bring the company there in September to play comic opera in a small theatre which had been built on purpose. Italian opera had hitherto never been presented at Valentia, and Marecalchi hoped to make a good deal of money there. Madame Pelliccia knew nobody in Valentia, and wanted a letter of introduction to someone there. She asked me if I thought she could venture to ask the Venetian ambassador to do her the favour, but I advised her to try the Duke of Arcos. \"Where is he?\" \"That gentleman who is looking in your direction now. \" \"How can I dare to ask him?\" \"He is a true nobleman, and I am sure he will be only too happy to oblige you. \" \"That would spoil everything; he must not even think that I am your adviser in the matter. I am just going to leave you; you must make your request directly afterwards.',\n",
       " '\" I walked towards the orchestra, and looking round I saw that the duke was approaching the actress. After the rehearsal was over Madame Pelliccia came and told me that the Duke would give her the letter on the day on which the opera was produced. He kept his word, and she received a sealed letter for a merchant and banker, Don Diego Valencia. It was then May, and she was not to go to Valentia till September, so we shall hear what the letter contained later on. I often saw the king\\'s gentleman of the chamber, Don Domingo Varnier, another \\'gentleman in the service of the Princess of the Asturias, and one of the princess\\'s bed–chamber women. This most popular princess succeeded in suppressing a good deal of the old etiquette, and the tone of her Court had lost the air of solemnity common in Spanish society. It was a strange thing to see the King of Spain always dining at eleven o\\'clock, like the Parisian cordwainers in the seventeenth century.',\n",
       " \"His meal always consisted of the same dishes, he always went out hunting at the same hour, coming back in the evening thoroughly fatigued. The king was ugly, but everything is relative, he was handsome compared with his brother, who was terrifically ugly. This brother never went anywhere without a picture of the Virgin, which Mengs had painted for him. The figure was depicted as seated on the grass with legs crossed after the Eastern fashion, and uncovered up to the knees. It was, in reality, a voluptuous painting; and the prince mistook for devotion that which was really a sinful passion, for it was impossible to look upon the figure without desiring to have the original within one's arms. However, the prince did not see this, and was delighted to find himself in love with the mother of the Saviour. In this he was a true Spaniard; they only love pictures of this kind, and interpret the passions they excite in the most favourable sense.\",\n",
       " 'At Madrid I had, seen a picture of the Madonna with the child at her breast. The place was filled all day by the devout, who came to adore the Mother of God, whose figure was only interesting by reason of her magnificent breast. The alms given at this chapel were so numerous, that in the hundred and fifty years, since the picture had been placed there, the clergy had been able to purchase numerous lamps and candlesticks of silver, and vessels of silver gilt, and even of gold. The doorway was always blocked by carriages, and a sentinel was placed there to keep order amongst the coachmen; no nobleman would pass by without going in to pray to the Virgin, and to contemplate those \\'beata ubera, quae lactaverunt aeterni patris filium\\'. When I returned to Madrid I wanted to pay a visit to the Abbe Pico, and told my coachman to take another way so as to avoid the crush in front of the chapel. \"It is not so frequented now, senor,\" said he, \"I can easily get by it.',\n",
       " '\" He went on his way, and I found the entrance to the chapel deserted. As I was getting out of the carriage I asked my coachman what was the reason of the change, and he replied,— \"Oh, senor! men are getting more wicked every day. \" This reason did not satisfy me, and when I had taken my chocolate with the abbe, an intelligent and venerable old man, I asked him why the chapel in question had lost its reputation. He burst out laughing, and replied,— \"Excuse me, I really cannot tell you. Go and see for yourself; your curiosity will soon be satisfied. \" As soon as I left him I went to the chapel, and the state of the picture told me all. The breast of the Virgin had disappeared under a kerchief which some profane brush had dared to paint over it. The beautiful picture was spoilt; the magic and fascination had disappeared. Even the teat had been painted out; the Child held on to nothing, and the head of the Virgin no longer appeared natural.',\n",
       " 'This disaster had taken place at the end of the Carnival of 1768. The old chaplain died, and the Vandal who succeeded him pronounced the painting to be a scandalous one, and robbed it of all its charm. He may have been in the right as a fool, but as a Christian and a Spaniard he was certainly in the wrong, and he was probably soon convinced of the mistake he had made by the diminution in the offerings of the faithful. My interest in the study of human nature made me call on this priest, whom I expected to find a stupid old man. I went one morning, but instead of being old, the priest was an active, clever–looking man of thirty, who immediately offered me chocolate with the best grace imaginable. I refused, as was my duty as a stranger, and indeed the Spaniards offer visitors chocolate so frequently at all hours, that if one accepted it all one would be choked.',\n",
       " 'I lost no time in exordiums, but came to the point at once, by saying that as a lover of paintings I had been grieved at finding the magnificent Madonna spoilt. \"Very likely,\" he replied, \"but it was exactly the physical beauty of the picture that rendered it in my eyes unfit to represent one whose aspect should purify and purge the senses, instead of exciting them. Let all the pictures in the world be destroyed, if they be found to have caused the commission of one mortal sin. \" \"Who allowed you to commit this mutilation? The Venetian State Inquisitors, even M. Barberigo, though he is a devout man, would have put you under the Leads for such a deed. The love of Paradise should not be allowed to interfere with the fine arts, and I am sure that St. Luke himself (who was a painter, as you know) would condemn you if he could come to life again. I have to say mass at that altar every day, and I am not ashamed to tell you that I was unable to consecrate.',\n",
       " 'You are a man and a Christian, you can excuse my weakness. That voluptuous picture drew away my thoughts from holy things. \" \"Who obliged you to look at it?\" \"I did not look at it; the devil, the enemy of God, made me see it in spite of myself. \" \"Then you should have mutilated yourself like Origen. Your generative organs, believe me, are not so valuable as the picture you have ruined. \" That young priest shewed me the door with such brusqueness that I felt sure he would inform against me to the Inquisition. I knew he would have no difficulty in finding out my name, so I resolved to be beforehand with him. Both my fear and my resolve were inspired by an incident which I shall mention as an episode. A few days before, I had met a Frenchman named Segur, who had just come out of the prisons of the Inquisition.',\n",
       " \"He had been shut up for three years for committing the following crime: In the hall of his house there was a fountain, composed of a marble basin and the statue of a naked child, who discharged the water in the same way as the well–known statue of Brussels, that is to say, by his virile member. The child might be a Cupid or an Infant Jesus, as you pleased, but the sculptor had adorned the head with a kind of aureole; and so the fanatics declared that it was a mocking of God. Poor Segur was accused of impiety, and the Inquisition dealt with him accordingly. I felt that my fault might be adjudged as great as Segur's, and not caring to run the risk of a like punishment I called on the bishop, who held the office of Grand Inquisitor, and told him word for word the conversation I had had with the iconoclast chaplain. I ended by craving pardon, if I had offended the chaplain, as I was a good Christian, and orthodox on all points.\",\n",
       " 'I had never expected to find the Grand Inquisitor of Madrid a kindly and intelligent, though ill–favoured, prelate; but so it was, and he did nothing but laugh from the beginning to the end of my story, for he would not let me call it a confession. \"The chaplain,\" he said, \"is himself blameworthy and unfit for his position, in that he has adjudged others to be as weak as himself; in fact, he has committed a wrong against religion. Nevertheless, my dear son, it was not wise of you to go and irritate him. \" As I had told him my name he shewed me, smilingly, an accusation against me, drawn up by someone who had witnessed the fact. The good bishop gently chid me for having called the friar–confessor of the Duke of Medina an ignoramus. He had refused to admit that a priest might say mass a second time on a high festival, after breaking his fast, on the command of his sovereign prince, who, by the hypothesis, had not heard mass before.',\n",
       " '\"You were quite right in your contention,\" said the Inquisitor, \"but yet every truth is not good to utter, and it was wrong to call the man an ignoramus in his presence. For the future you would do well to avoid all idle discussion on religious matters, both on dogma and discipline. And I must also tell you, in order that you may not leave Spain with any harsh ideas on the Inquisition, that the priest who affixed your name to the church–door amongst the excommunicated has been severely reprimanded. He ought to have given you a fatherly admonition, and, above all, enquired as to your health, as we know that you were seriously ill at the time. \" Thereupon I knelt down and kissed his hand, and went my way, well pleased with my call. As soon as I heard that the ambassador could not put me up at Madrid, I wrote to the worthy cobbler, Don Diego, that I wanted a well–furnished room, a closet, a good bed, and an honest servant.',\n",
       " 'I informed him how much I was willing to spend a month, and said I would leave Aranjuez as soon as I heard that everything was ready. I was a good deal occupied with the question of colonising the Sierra Morena; I wrote principally on the subject of the civil government, a most important item in a scheme for a new colony. My articles pleased the Marquis Grimaldi and flattered Mocenigo; for the latter hoped that I should become governor of the colony, and that his embassy would thereby shine with a borrowed light. My labours did not prevent my amusing myself, and I frequented the society of those about the Court who could tell me most of the king and royal family. Don Varnier, a man of much frankness and intelligence, was my principal source of information. I asked him one day whether the king was fond of Gregorio Squillace only because he had been once his wife\\'s lover. \"If the epithet of \\'chaste\\' can be applied to any monarch, Charles III.',\n",

He has avoided this sin that his soul may remain pure, and so as not to have the shame of confessing it to his chaplain. He enjoys an iron constitution, sickness is unknown to him, and he is a thorough Spaniard in temperament. Ever since his marriage he has paid his duty to his wife every day, except when the state of her health compelled her to call for a truce. In such seasons this chaste husband brought down his fleshly desires by the fatigue of hunting and by abstinence. You can imagine his distress at being left a widower, for he would rather die than take a mistress. His only resource was in hunting, and in so planning out his day that he should have no time left wherein to think of women. It was a difficult matter, for he cares neither for reading nor writing, music wearies him, and conversation of a lively turn inspires him with disgust.',\n",

At eight o\\'clock he says his prayers, then hears mass, and when this is over he takes chocolate and an enormous pinch of snuff, over which his big nose ruminates for some minutes; this is his only pinch in the whole day. At nine o\\'clock he sees his ministers, and works with them till eleven. Then comes dinner, which he always takes alone, then a short visit to the Princess of the Austurias, and at twelve sharp he gets into his carriage and drives to the hunting–grounds. At seven o\\'clock he takes a morsel wherever he happens to be, and at eight o\\'clock he comes home, so tired that he often goes to sleep before he can get his clothes off. \" \"Poor voluntary martyr!\" \"He thought of marrying a second time, but when Adelaide of France saw his portrait she was quite frightened and refused him.',\n",
       " 'He was very mortified, and renounced all thoughts of marriage; and woe to the courtier who should advise him to get a mistress!\" In further speaking of his character Don Domingo told me that the ministers had good cause for making him inaccessible, as whenever anyone did succeed in getting at him and asked a favour, he made a point of granting it, as it was at such times that he felt himself really a king. \"Then he is not a hard man, as some say?\" \"Not at all.

Mocenigo three days before he left Aranjuez, and I embraced Manucci affectionately. My cobbler had written to tell me that for the sum I had mentioned he could provide me with a Biscayan maid who could cook.',\n",
       " 'He sent me the address of my new lodging in the Calle Alcala. I arrived there in the afternoon, having started from Aranjuez in the morning. I found that the Biscayan maid could speak French; my room was a very pleasant one, with another chamber annexed where I could lodge a friend. After I had had my effects carried up I saw my man, whose face pleased me. I was anxious to test the skill of my cook, so I ordered her to get a good supper for me, and I gave her some money. \"I have some money,\" she replied, \"and I will let you have the bill to– morrow. \" After taking away whatever I had left with Mengs I went to Don Diego\\'s house, and to my astonishment found it empty. I went back and asked Philippe, my man, where Don Diego was staying. \"It\\'s some distance, sir; I will take you there tomorrow. \" \"Where is my landlord?\" \"In the floor above; but they are very quiet people. \" At nine o\\'clock I was told that my supper was ready.',\n",
       " 'I was very hungry, and the neatness with which the table was laid was a pleasant surprise in Spain. I was sorry that I had had no opportunity of expressing my satisfaction to Don Diego, but I sat down to supper. Then indeed I thought the cobbler a hero; the Biscayan maid might have entered into rivalry with the best cook in France. There were five dishes, including my favourite delicacy \\'las criadillas\\', and everything was exquisite. My lodging was dear enough, but the cook made the whole arrangement a wonderful bargain. Towards the end of supper Philippe told me that the landlord had come in, and that with my leave he would wish me a good evening. \" I saw Don Diego and his charming daughter enter; he had rented the house on purpose to be my landlord.',\n",
       " 'Chapter VI My Amours With Donna Ignazia--return of M. De Mocenino to Madrid All you barons, counts, and marquises who laugh at an untitled man who calls himself a gentleman, pause and reflect, spare your disdain till you have degraded him; allow him a gentle title so long as he does gentle deeds. Respect the man that defines nobility in a new way, which you cannot understand. With him nobility is not a series of descents from father to son; he laughs at pedigrees, in which no account is taken of the impure blood introduced by wifely infidelities; he defines a nobleman as one who does noble deeds, who neither lies nor cheats, who prefers his honour to his life. This latter part of the definition should make you tremble for your lives, if you meditate his dishonour. From imposture comes contempt, from contempt hatred, from hatred homicide, which takes out the blot of dishonour.',\n",
       " 'The cobbler Don Diego might have feared, perhaps, that I should laugh at him, when he told me he was noble; but feeling himself to be really so he had done his best to prove it to me. The fineness of his behaviour when I was in prison had given me some idea of the nobility of his soul, but he was not content with this. On the receipt of my letter, he had taken a new house only to give up the best part of it to me. No doubt he calculated on not losing in the long run, as after I had left he would probably have no difficulty in letting the apartment, but his chief motive was to oblige me. He was not disappointed; henceforth I treated him entirely as an equal. Donna Ignazia was delighted at what her father had done for me. We talked an hour, settling our business relations over a bottle of excellent wine. I succeeded in my contention that the Biscayan cook should be kept at my expense.',\n",
       " \"All the same, I wanted the girl to think that she was in Don Diego's service, so I begged him to pay her every day, as I should take all my meals at home, at all events, till the return of the ambassador. I also told him that it was a penance to me to eat alone, and begged him to keep me company at dinner and supper every day. He tried to excuse himself, and at last gave in on the condition that his daughter should take his place when he had too much work to do. As may be imagined I had anticipated this condition, and made no difficulty about it. The next morning, feeling curious to see the way in which my landlord was lodged, I paid him a visit. I went into the little room sacred to Donna Ignazia. A bed, a chest, and a chair made up the whole furniture; but beside the bed was a desk before a picture, four feet high, representing St. Ignatius de Loyola as a fine young man, more calculated to irritate the sense than to arouse devotion.\",\n",
       " 'My cobbler said to me, \"I have a much better lodging than I had before; and the rent of your room pays me for the house four times over. \" \"How about the furniture and the linen?\" \"It will all be paid in the course of four years. It is an excellent speculation, and I have to thank you for it. \" \"I am glad to hear it; but what is this, you seem to be making new boots?\" \"Quite so; but if you look you will see that I am working on a last which has been given me. In this way I have not to put them on, nor need I trouble myself whether they fit well or ill. \" \"Yes, but there\\'s a great difference between my work and my leather, and the usual work and leather of the bootmakers. \" \"Then I will have a last made, and you shall make me a pair of shoes, if you will; but I warn you they must be of the finest skin, and the soles of morocco. \" \"I can\\'t help that; I can\\'t bear any but the lightest boots. \" Before I left him he said his daughter should dine with me that day as he was very busy.',\n",
       " 'I called on the Count of Aranda, who received me coldly, but with great politeness. I told him how I had been treated by my parish priest and by Mengs. \"I heard about it; this was worse than your imprisonment, and I don\\'t know what I could have done for you if you had not communicated, and obliged the priest to take out your name. Just now they are trying to annoy me with posters on the walls, but I take no notice. \" \"What do they want your excellency to do?\" \"To allow long cloaks and low–crowned hats; you must know all about it. Don\\'t come here on Sunday, as my house is to be blown up. \" \"I should like to see that, my lord, so I will be in your hall at noon. The count was addressing the company, under the last poster threatening him with death, two very energetic lines were inscribed by the person who put up the poster, knowing that he was at the same time running his head into the noose: Si me cogen, me horqueran, Pero no me cogeran.',\n",
       " '\"If they catch me, they will hang me, So I shall not let them catch me. \" At dinner Donna Ignazia told me how glad she was to have me in the house, but she did not respond to all my amorous speeches after Philippe had left the room. She blushed and sighed, and then being obliged to say something, begged me to forget everything that had passed between us. I smiled, and said that I was sure she knew she was asking an impossibility. I added that even if I could forget the past I would not do so. I knew that she was neither false nor hypocritical, and felt sure that her behaviour proceeded from devotion; but I knew this could not last long. I had had to do so with other devotees who had loved me less than she, nevertheless, they had capitulated. After dinner she remained a quarter of an hour with me, but I refrained from any amorous attempts. After my siesta I dressed, and went out without seeing her.',\n",
       " 'In the evening when she came in for her father, who had supped with me, I treated her with the greatest politeness without shewing any ill–humour. At dinner she told me she had broken with her lover at the beginning of Lent, and begged me not to see him if he called on me. On Whit Sunday I called on the Count of Aranda, and Don Diego, who was exquisitely dressed, dined with me. I asked after her, and Don Diego replied, with a smile, that she had shut herself up in her room to celebrate the Feast of Pentecost. He pronounced these words in a manner and with a smile that he would not have dared to use if he had been speaking to a fellow–Spaniard. He added that she would, no doubt, come down and sup with me, as he was going to sup with his brother. \"My dear Don Diego, don\\'t let there be any false compliments between us. Before you go out, tell your daughter not to put herself out for me, and that I do not pretend to put my society in comparison with that of God.',\n",
       " 'Tell her to keep her room to–night, and she can sup with me another time. \" After my siesta, the worthy man said that Donna Ignazia thanked me and would profit by my kindness, as she did not want to see anyone on that holy day. \"I am very glad she has taken me at my word, and to–morrow I will thank her for it. \" I had some difficulty in shaping my lips to this reply; for this excess of devotion displeased me, and even made me tremble for her love. I could not help laughing, however, when Don Diego said that a wise father forgives an ecstasy of love. I had not expected such a philosophic remark from the mouth of a Spaniard. The weather was unpleasant, so I resolved to stay indoors. I told Philippe that I should not want the carriage, and that he could go out. I told my Biscayan cook that I should not sup till ten. When I was alone I wrote for some time, and in the evening the mother lit my candles, instead of the daughter, so in the end I went to bed without any supper.',\n",
       " 'At nine o\\'clock next morning, just as I was awaking, Donna Ignazia appeared, to my great astonishment, telling me how sorry she was to hear that I had not taken any supper. \"Alone, sad, and unhappy,\" I replied, \"I felt that abstinence was the best thing for me. I then went to mass at the Church of the Good Success, where I saw all the handsome courtezans in Madrid. I dined with Don Diego, and when his daughter came in with dessert he told her that it was her fault I had gone supperless to bed. \"Would you like to come with me to our Lady of Atocha?\" said I. \"I should like it very much,\" she replied, with a side–glance at her father. \"My girl,\" said Don Diego, \"true devotion and merriment go together, and the reason is that the truly devout person has trust in God and in the honesty of all men. Thus you can trust in Don Jaime as an honest man, though he has not the good fortune to be born in Spain. \" I could not help laughing at this last sentence, but Don Diego was not offended.',\n",
       " 'Donna Ignazia kissed her father\\'s hands, and asked if she might bring her cousin too. \"What do you want to take the cousin for?\" said Don Diego; \"I will answer for Don Jaime. \" \"You are very kind, Don Diego, but if Ignazia likes her cousin to come I shall be delighted, provided it be the elder cousin, whom I like better than the younger. \" After this arrangement the father went his way, and I sent Philippe to the stables to put in four mules. When we were alone Ignazia asked me repentantly to forgive her. \" \"Alas, dearest! I think I shall go mad if I keep up the battle any longer. \" \"There needs no battle, dearest Ignazia, either love me as I love you, or tell me to leave the house, and see you no more. But allow me to tell you that you are mistaken in your estimate of my cousins\\' characters. I know what influenced you, but you do not know all. The younger is a good girl, and though she is ugly, she too has succumbed to love.',\n",
       " 'But the elder, who is ten times uglier, is mad with rage at never having had a lover. She thought she had made you in love with her, and yet she speaks evil of you. She reproaches me for having yielded so easily and boasts that she would never have gratified your passion. \" \"Say no more, we must punish her; and the younger shall come. \" \"Does she know that we love each other?\" \"I have never told her, but she has guessed it, and pities me. She wants me to join her in a devotion to Our Lady de la Soledad, the effect of which would be a complete cure for us both. \" \"Then she is in love, too?\" \"Yes; and she is unhappy in her love, for it is not returned. \" \"I pity her, and yet, with such a face, I do not know any man who would take compassion on her. \" \"Say nothing about me: my danger is greater than hers.',\n",
       " 'I am forced to defend myself or to give in, and God knows there are some men whom it is impossible to ward off! God is my witness that in Holy Week I went to a poor girl with the smallpox, and touched her in the hope of catching it, and so losing my beauty; but God would not have it so, and my confessor blamed me, bidding me to do a penance I had never expected. \" \"Tell me what it is?\" \"He told me that a handsome face is the index of a handsome soul, and is a gift of God, for which a woman should render thanks continually; that in attempting to destroy this beauty I had sinned, for I had endeavoured to destroy God\\'s handiwork. After a good deal of rebuke in this style, he ordered me to put a little rouge on my cheeks whenever I felt myself looking pale. I had to submit, and I have bought a pot of rouge, but hitherto I have not felt obliged to use it. Indeed, my father might notice it, and I should not like to tell him that it is done by way of penance.',\n",

Before him I had a confessor who was quite unbearable. He asked me questions which made me quite indignant. \" \"What questions were these?\" \"You must please excuse me telling you. \" \"Why do you go to confession so often?\" \"Why? Would to God I had not good cause! but after all I only go once a week. \" \"Not so, for when I am in mortal sin I cannot sleep at night. \" \"I pity you, dearest; I have a consolation which is denied you. I have an infinite trust in the infinite mercy of God. We found a good many carriages in front of the church–door, and the church itself was full of devotees, both male and female.',\n",
       " \"Amongst others I saw the Duchess of Villadorias, notorious for her andromania. When the 'furor uterinus' seized her, nothing could keep her back. She would rush at the man who had excited her, and he had no choice but to satisfy her passion. This had happened several times in public assemblies, and had given rise to some extraordinary scenes. I had seen her at a ball; she was still both young and pretty. As I entered the church I saw her kneeling on the stones of the church floor. She lifted her eyes, and gazed at me, as if doubtful whether she knew me or not, as she had only seen me in domino. After my devotees had prayed for half an hour, they rose to go, and the duchess rose also; and as soon as we were out of the church she asked me if I knew her. I replied in the affirmative, and she asked why I had not been to see her, and if I visited the Duchess of Benevento. I told her that I did not visit her grace, and that I should have the honour of paying her a call before long.\",\n",
       " \"On our way I explained to my two companions the nature of the duchess's malady. Donna Ignazia asked me anxiously if I really meant to go and see her. She seemed reassured when I replied in the negative. A common and to my mind a ridiculous question is which of the two sexes enjoys the generative act the more. Homer gives us Jupiter and Juno disputing on this point. Tiresias, who was once a woman, has given a correct though amusing decision on the point. A laconic answer has it that a woman enjoys the act the most because with her it is sharper, repeated more frequently, and finally because the battle is fought in her field. She is at the same time an active and passive agent, while action is indispensable to the pleasure of the man. But the most conclusive reason is that if the woman's pleasure were not the greater nature would be unjust, and she never is or can be unjust. Nothing in this universe is without its use, and no pleasure or pain is without its compensation or balance.\",\n",
       " 'If woman had not more pleasure than man she would not have more organs than he. The greater nervous power planted in the female organ is demonstrated by the andromania to which some women are subject, and which makes them either Messalines or martyrs. Nature has given to women this special enjoyment to compensate for the pains they have to undergo. What man would expose himself, for the pleasure he enjoys, to the pains of pregnancy and the dangers of childbed? But women will do so again and again; so it must be concluded that they believe the pleasure to outbalance the pain; and so it is clearly the woman who has the better share in the enjoyment. In spite of this, if I had the choice of being born again as a woman, I should say no; for in spite of my voluptuousness, a man has pleasures which a woman cannot enjoy. Though, indeed, rather than not be born again, I would be a woman, and even a brute, provided always that I had my memory, for without it I should no longer be myself.',\n",
       " \"We had some ices, and my two companions returned home with me, well pleased with the enjoyment I had given them without offending God. Donna Ignazia, who was delighted with my continence during the day, and apparently afraid of its not lasting, begged me to invite her cousin to supper. The cousin was ugly, and also a fool, but she had a great heart and was sympathetic. I knew that Donna Ignazia had told her all, and as she was no restraint on me I did not mind her being at supper, while Ignazia looked upon her as a safeguard. The table had been laid for three, when I heard a step coming up the stairs. Don Diego was a pleasant man, as I have said, but what amused me most of all about him was his moral maxims. He knew or suspected that I was fond of his daughter, though in an honourable way; he thought my honour or his daughter's piety would be a sufficient safeguard. If he had suspected what had really happened, I do not think he would ever have allowed us to be together.\",\n",
       " 'He sat beside his niece and facing his daughter, and did most of the talking, for your Spaniard, though grave, is eloquent, and fond of hearing the fine harmonies of his native tongue. It was very hot, so I asked him to take off his waistcoat, and to tell his daughter to do just as she would if only he and his wife had been present. Donna Ignazia had not to be entreated long before she took off her kerchief, but the poor cousin did not like having to shew us her bones and swarthy skin. Donna Ignazia told her father how much she had enjoyed herself, and how they had seen the Duchess of Villadorias, who had asked me to come and see her. The good man began to philosophise and to jest on her malady, and he told me some stories, germane to the question, which the girls pretended not to understand. The good wine of La Mancha kept us at table till a late hour, and the time seemed to pass very quickly.',\n",
       " 'Don Diego told his niece that she could sleep with his daughter, in the room we were in, as the bed was big enough for two. I hastened to add that if the ladies would do so I should be delighted; but Donna Ignazia blushed and said it would not do, as the room was only separated from mine by a glass door. At this I smiled at Don Diego, who proceeded to harangue his daughter in a manner which amused me extremely. He told her that I was at least twenty years older than herself, and that in suspecting me she had committed a greater sin than if she allowed me to take some slight liberty. \"I am sure,\" he added, \"that when you go to confession next Sunday you will forget to accuse yourself of having wrongfully suspected Don Jaime of a dishonourable action. \" Donna Ignazia looked at me affectionately, asked my pardon, and said she would do whatever her father liked.',\n",
       " 'The cousin said nothing, and the father kissed his daughter, bade me a good night, and went away well pleased with the harangue he had delivered. I suspected that Donna Ignazia expected me to make some attempt on her honour, and feeling sure that she would resist for the sake of appearance, I determined to leave her in peace. Next morning I got up and went into their room in the hope of playing some trick on them. However, the birds were flown, and I had no doubt that they had gone to hear mass. She told me she had been in the church for three hours. \"You have been to confession, I suppose?\" \"No; I went last Sunday, and I shall wait till next Sunday. \" \"I am very glad that your confession will not be lengthened by any sins I have helped you to commit. \" \"Wrong? I understand; but you must know that I am not going to be damned for mere desires. I do not wish to torment you or to become a martyr myself.',\n",
       " 'What you granted me has made me fall deeply in love with you, and it makes me shudder when I imagine that our love has become a subject of repentance with you. I have had a bad night; and it is time for me to think of my health. I must forget you, but to bring about that effect I will see you no longer. I will keep on the house, but I will not live in it. If your religion is an intelligent one, you will approve of my idea. Tell your confessor of it next Sunday, and you will see that he will approve it. You can go away if you like, and I shall say nothing, but I shall be the most unhappy girl in all Madrid. \" As she spoke these words, two big tears rolled down her cheeks, and her face dropped; I was profoundly moved. \"I love you, dearest Ignazia, and I hope not to be damned for my love. I cannot see you without loving you and to this love some positive proof is essential; otherwise, I am unhappy.',\n",
       " 'If I go you say you will be unhappy, and if I stay it is I that will be unhappy, my health will be ruined. \" \"Then you must be as loving and tender as you were before. I tell you to stay, because I am sure that in eight or ten days we shall have become so accustomed to one another that I shall be able to love you like a father, and you will be able to take me in your arms without any amorous sentiments. \" \"Are you sure of this?\" \"Yes, dearest, quite sure. \" \"Let me be mistaken, and believe me I shall be glad to be mistaken. \" \"Unhappy devotee!\" \"Why unhappy?\" \"Nothing, nothing. I may be too long, I shall endanger … let us say no more about it. \" I went out more pained with her state than my own, and I felt that the best thing I could do would be to forget her, \"for,\" said I to myself, \"even if I do enjoy her once, Sunday will come again; she will confess, repent, and I shall have to begin all over again.',\n",
       " 'She confessed her love, and flatters herself that she will be able to subdue it—a foolish hope, which could only exist in a mind under the dominion of prejudice. \" I came home at noon, and Don Diego dined with me; his daughter did not appear till the dessert. Her father asked her jestingly if I had paid her a visit in the night. \"I never suspected Don Jaime of such a thing,\" she replied, \"and I only objected out of shyness. \" I interrupted her by praising her modesty, and telling her that she would have done quite right to beware of me, if my sense of duty had not been stronger than any voluptuous desires inspired by her charms. Don Diego pronounced this declaration of love as good as anything to be found in the \"Morte d\\'Arthur. \" His daughter said I was laughing at her, but Don Diego said he was certain that I was in earnest, and that I had known her before taking her to the ball. \"You are utterly mistaken,\" said Donna Ignazia, with some degree of fire.',\n",
       " '\"What! How and when did you see me?\" \"At the church where I heard mass, and you communicated, when you went out with your cousin. I followed you at some distance; you can guess the rest. \" She was speechless, and her father enjoyed the consciousness of his superior intellect. \"I am going to see the bull fight,\" said he; \"it\\'s a fine day, and all Madrid will be there, so one must go early to get a good place. I advise you to go, as you have never seen a bull fight; ask Don Jaime to take you with him, Ignazia. \" \"Would you like to have my companionship?\" said she, tenderly. \"Certainly I would, but you must bring your cousin, as I am in love with her. \" Don Diego burst out laughing, but Ignazia said, slyly, \"It is not so impossible after all. \" We went to see the splendid but barbarous spectacle in which Spaniards take so much delight. The two girls placed themselves in front of the only vacant box, and I sat behind on the second bench, which was a foot and a half higher than the first.',\n",
       " 'There were already two ladies there, and much to my amusement one of them was the famous Duchess of Villadorias. She was in front of me, and sat in such a position that her head was almost between my legs. She recognized me, and said we were fortunate in meeting one another; and then noticing Donna Ignazia, who was close to her, she congratulated me in French on her charms, and asked me whether she was my mistress or my wife. I replied that she was a beauty before whom I sighed in vain. She replied, with a smile, that she was rather a sceptical person; and turning to Donna Ignazia began a pleasant and amorous discourse, thinking the girl to be as learned in the laws of love as herself. She whispered something in her ear which made Ignazia blush, and the duchess, becoming enthusiastic, told me I had chosen the handsomest girl in Madrid, and that she would be delighted to see us both at her country house.',\n",
       " \"I promised to come, as I was obliged to do, but I begged to be excused naming the day. Nevertheless, she made me promise to call on her at four o'clock the next day, telling me, much to my terror, that she would be alone. She was pretty enough, but too notorious a character; and such a visit would have given rise to talk. Happily the fight began, and silence became general, for the Spaniards are passionately devoted of bull fighting. So much has been written on the subject that my readers will pardon my giving a detailed account of the fight. I may say that the sport is, in my opinion, a most barbarous one, and likely to operate unfavourably on the national morals; the arena is sometimes drenched in the blood of bulls, horses, and even of the unfortunate picadores and matadores, whose sole defence is the red rag with which they irritate the bull.\",\n",
       " 'When it was over I escorted the girls—who had enjoyed themselves immensely—back to the house, and made the ugly cousin stay to supper, as I foresaw that they would again sleep together. We supped together, but it was a melancholy affair, for Don Diego was away, and I did not feel in the humour to amuse my company. Donna Ignazia became pensive when, in reply to a question of hers, I said that it would be absolutely rude of me not to go to the duchess\\'s. \"You will come with me some day,\" I added, \"to dine at her country house. She talked to me in a way that would have offended me if I did not know that she fancied she was honouring me by laying aside her rank. \" We rose from table, and after I had dismissed my man we sat on the balcony to wait for Don Diego and to enjoy the delicious evening breezes. As we sat near to each other in the twilight, so favourable to lovers\\' vows, I looked into Donna Ignazia\\'s eyes, and saw there that my hour had come.',\n",
       " 'I clasped her to me with one arm, I clung with my lips to hers, and by the way she trembled I guessed the flame which consumed her. \"Will you go and see the duchess?\" \"No, if you will promise me not to go to confession next Sunday. \" \"But what will he say if I do not go?\" \"Nothing at all, if he understands his business. \" We were so tightly clasped together that the cousin, like a good girl, left us, and went to the other end of the balcony, taking care to look away from us. Without changing my position, in spite of the temptation to do so, I asked her if she felt in the humour to repent of the sin she was ready to commit. \"I was not thinking of repentance just then, but as you remind me of it, I must tell you that I shall certainly go to confession. \" \"And after you have been to confession will you love me as you love me now?\" \"I hope God will give me strength to offend Him no more.',\n",
       " '\" \"I assure you that if you continue loving me God will not give you grace, yet I feel sure that on Sunday evening you will refuse me that which you are now ready to grant. \" \"Indeed I will, sweetheart; but why should we talk of that now?\" \"Because if I abandon myself to pleasure now I shall be more in love with you than ever, and consequently more unhappy than ever, when the day of your repentance comes. So promise me that you will not go to confession whilst I remain at Madrid, or give the fatal order now, and bid me leave you. I cannot abandon myself to love to–day knowing that it will be refused me on Sunday. \" As I remonstrated thus, I clasped her affectionately in my arms, caressing her most ardently; but before coming to the decisive action I asked her again whether she would promise not to go to confession next Sunday. \"You are cruel,\" said she, \"I cannot make you that promise for my conscience sake.',\n",
       " '\" At this reply, which I had quite expected, I remained motionless, feeling sure that she must be in a state of desperate irritation at the work half begun and not concluded. I, too, suffered, for I was at the door of the sanctuary, and a slight movement would have sent me into the inmost shrine; but I knew that her torments must be greater than mine, and that she could not resist long. Donna Ignazia was indeed in a terrible state; I had not repulsed her, but I was perfectly inactive. Modesty prevented her asking me openly to continue, but she redoubled her caresses, and placed herself in an easier position, reproaching me with my cruelty. I do not know whether I could have held out much longer, but just then the cousin turned round and told us that Don Diego was coming in. We hastened to arrange our toilette, and to sit in a decent position. The cousin came up to us, and Don Diego, after making a few remarks, left us on the balcony, wishing us a good night.',\n",
       " 'I might have begun over again, but I clung to my system of repression, and after wishing the girls good night with a melancholy air, I went to bed. I hoped Donna Ignazia would repent and come and keep me company, but I was disappointed. They left their room early in the morning, and at noon Don Diego came to dine with me, saying his daughter had such a bad headache that she had not even gone to mass. \" \"No, I think abstinence will do her good, and in the evening I daresay she will be able to sup with you. \" I went to keep her company by her bedside after I had taken my siesta. I did my best for three hours to convince her of her folly; but she kept her eyes closed, and said nothing, only sighing when I said something very touching. Jerome\\'s Park, and told her that if she did not sup with me I should understand that she did not wish to see me again. She came to table at supper–time, but she looked pale and exhausted. She ate little, and said nothing, for she knew not what to say.',\n",
       " 'I saw that she was suffering, and I pitied her from my heart. Before going to bed she asked me if I had been to see the duchess. She seemed somewhat cheered when I answered in the negative. I told her that she might satisfy herself of the truth of my reply by asking Philippe, who had taken my note begging her grace to excuse me for that day. \"But will you go another day?\" \"No, dearest, because I see it would grieve you. \" She gave a sigh of content, and I embraced her gently, and she left me as sad as I was. I could see that what I asked of her was a great deal; but I had good grounds for hope, as I knew her ardent disposition. It was not God and I that were disputing for her, but her confessor and I. If she had not been a Catholic I should have won her the first day.',\n",
       " \"She had told me that she would get into trouble with her confessor if she did not go to him as usual; she had too much of fine Spanish honour in her to tell him what was not true, or to endeavour to combine her love with her religion. The Friday and the Saturday passed without any events of consequence. Her father, who could not blind himself to our love any longer, trusted, I suppose, to his daughter's virtue, and made her dine and sup with me every day. On Saturday evening Donna Ignazia left me sadder than ever, and turned her head away when I would have kissed her as usual. I saw what was the matter; she was going to communicate the next day. I admired her consistency, in spite of myself, and pitied her heartily; for I could guess the storm that must be raging in her breast. I began to repent having demanded all, and wished I had been contented with a little. I wished to be satisfied with my own eyes, and got up early on Sunday morning and followed her.\",\n",
       " 'I knew that she would call for her cousin, so I went on to the church. I placed myself by the sacristy–door, where I could see without being seen. I waited a quarter of an hour, then they came in, and after kneeling down for a few moments, separated, each going to her own confessor. I only noticed Donna Ignazia; I saw her going to the confessional, and the confessor turning towards her. I thought the confession would never come to an end. \"What is he saying?\" I repeated to myself as I saw the confessor speaking to her now and again. I could bear it no longer, and I was on the point of going away when I saw her rise from her knees. Donna Ignazia, looking like a saint, came to kneel in the church, but out of my sight. I thought she would come forward to receive the Holy Communion at the end of the Mass that was being said, but instead of that she went towards the door, rejoined her cousin and they left the church.',\n",
       " '\"The poor girl has made a sincere and full confession, she has avowed her love, and the priest\\'s cruel duty has made him refuse her absolution. What will come of it?\" \"My peace of mind and hers require me to leave her. \"Wretch that I am, to have lost all for all! I should have made allowance for the peculiar Spanish character. \"I might have enjoyed her by surprise now and again; the difficulty would have added piquancy to the intrigue. I have behaved as if I were once more twenty, and I have lost all. I must find some way out of this terrible situation. \" Thus soliloquising, I came home ill pleased with the line of conduct I had adopted. My hairdresser was waiting for me, but I sent him away, and told my cook not to serve my dinner till I ordered it; then, feeling the need of rest, I flung myself on my bed and slept profoundly till one o\\'clock. I got up and ordered dinner to be brought in, and sent a message to the father and daughter that I was expecting them.',\n",
       " 'My surprise may be imagined when Donna Ignazia appeared in a costume of black velvet, adorned with ribbons and lace. In my opinion there is no more seductive costume in Europe when the wearer is pretty. I also noticed that every feature of her face breathed peace and calm; I had never seen her looking so well, and I could not help congratulating her. She replied with a smile, and I gave her a kiss, which she took as meekly as a lamb. I saw that my fair sweetheart had crossed the Rubicon; the day was won. \"I am going to be happy,\" said she, \"but let us say nothing, and it will come of itself. \" However, I did not conceal my bliss, and made love to her whenever the servant was out of the room. Before we left the table she asked me if I still loved her. \" When my hair was done I made an elaborate toilette, and burning with impatience we set out on foot, as I was afraid we should not secure a good place if we waited till the carriage was ready.',\n",
       " 'We found a fine box with only two persons in it, and Ignazia, after glancing round, said she was glad that the detestable duchess was not anywhere near us. After some fine sport my mistress begged me to take her to the Prado, where all the best people in Madrid are to be seen. Donna Ignazia leant on my arm, seemed proud to be thought mine, and filled me with delight. All at once we met the Venetian ambassador and his favourite, Manucci. We greeted each other with due Spanish politeness, and the ambassador paid me a high compliment on the beauty of my companion. Donna Ignazia pretended not to understand, but she pressed my arm with Spanish delicacy. de Mocenigo said he hoped I would dine with him on the following day, and after I had nodded acquiescence in the French style we parted. Towards the evening we took some ices and returned home, and the gentle pressure of my arm on the way prepared me for the bliss I was to enjoy.',\n",
       " 'He congratulated his daughter on her pleasant appearance and the pleasure she must have taken in my society. Charmed with papa\\'s good humour, I asked him to sup with us, and he accepted, and amused us with his witty conversation and a multitude of little tales that pleased me exceedingly. He made the following speech on leaving us, which I give word for word, but I cannot give the reader any idea of the inimitable Spanish gravity with which it was delivered. \"Amigo Senior Don Jaime, I leave you here to enjoy the cool air with my daughter. I am delighted at your loving her, and you may be assured that I shall place no obstacle in the way of your becoming my son–in–law as soon as you can shew your titles of nobility. \" When he was gone, I said to his daughter,— \"I should be only too happy, if it could be managed; but you must know that in my country they only are called nobles who have an hereditary right to rule the state.',\n",
       " 'If I had been born in Spain I should be noble, but as it is I adore you, and I hope you will make me happy. \" \"Yes, dearest, but we must be happy together; I cannot suffer any infidelity. \" \"I give you my word of honour that I will be wholly faithful to you. \" \"No, let us put out the lights, and stay here a quarter of an hour. Tell me, my angel, whence comes this unexpected happiness?\" \"You owe it to a piece of tyranny which drove me to desperation. God is good, and I am sure He would not have me become my own executioner. When I told my confessor that I could not help loving you, but that I could restrain myself from all excess of love, he replied that this self– confidence was misplaced, as I had already fallen. He wanted me to promise never to be alone with you again, and on my refusing to do so he would not give me absolution. \"I have never had such a piece of shame cast on me, but I laid it all in the hands of God, and said, \\'Thy will be done.',\n",
       " '\\' \"Whilst I heard mass my mind was made up, and as long as you love me I shall be yours, and yours only. When you leave Spain and abandon me to despair, I shall find another confessor. My conscience holds me guiltless; this is my comfort. My cousin, whom I have told all, is astonished, but then she is not very clever. \" After this declaration, which put me quite at my ease, and would have relieved me of any scruples if I had had them, I took her to my bed. In the morning, she left me tired out, but more in love with her than ever.',\n",

Nevertheless, seeing that men are divided into two sections, the one and by far the greater composed of the ignorant and superficial, and the other of the learned and reflective, I beg to state that it is to the latter I would appeal. Their judgment, I believe, will be in favour of my veracity, and, indeed, why should I not be veracious? A man can have no object in deceiving himself, and it is for myself that I chiefly write.',\n",
       " \"Hitherto I have spoken nothing but the truth, without considering whether the truth is in my favour or no. My book is not a work of dogmatic theology, but I do not think it will do harm to anyone; while I fancy that those who know how to imitate the bee and to get honey from every flower will be able to extract some good from the catalogue of my vices and virtues. After this digression (it may be too long, but that is my business and none other's), I must confess that never have I had so unpleasant a truth to set down as that which I am going to relate. I committed a fatal act of indiscretion—an act which after all these years still gives my heart a pang as I think of it. The day after my conquest I dined with the Venetian ambassador, and I had the pleasure of hearing that all the ministers and grandees with whom I had associated had the highest possible opinion of me.\",\n",
       " 'In three or four days the king, the royal family, and the ministers would return to town, and I expected to have daily conferences with the latter respecting the colony in the Sierra Morena, where I should most probably be going. Manucci, who continued to treat me as a valued friend, proposed to accompany me on my journey, and would bring with him an adventuress, who called herself Porto–Carrero, pretending to be the daughter or niece of the late cardinal of that name, and thus obtained a good deal of consideration; though in reality she was only the mistress of the French consul at Madrid, the Abbe Bigliardi. Such was the promising state of my prospects when my evil genius brought to Madrid a native of Liege, Baron de Fraiture, chief huntsman of the principality, and a profligate, a gamester, and a cheat, like all those who proclaim their belief in his honesty nowadays. I had unfortunately met him at Spa, and told him I was was going to Portugal.',\n",
       " 'He had come after me, hoping to use me as a means of getting into good society, and of filling his pocket with the money of the dupes he aspired to make. Gamesters have never had any proof of my belonging to their infernal clique, but they have always persisted in believing that I too am a \"Greek. \" As soon as this baron heard that I was in Madrid he called on me, and by dint of politeness obliged me to receive him. I thought any small civilities I might shew or introductions I might give could do me no harm. He had a travelling companion to whom he introduced me. He was a fat, ignorant fellow, but a Frenchman, and therefore agreeable. A Frenchman who knows how to present himself, who is well dressed, and has the society air, is usually accepted without demur or scrutiny. He had been a cavalry captain, but had been fortunate enough to obtain an everlasting furlough. Four or five days after his appearance the baron asked me quietly enough to lend him a score of louis, as he was hard up.',\n",
       " 'I replied as quietly, thanking him for treating me as a friend, but informing him that I really could not lend him the money, as I wanted what little I had for my own necessities. \"But we can do good business together, and you cannot possibly be moneyless. \" \"I do not know anything about good business, but I do know that I want my money and cannot part with it. \" \"We are at our wits\\' end to quiet our landlord; come and speak to him. \" \"If I were to do so I should do you more harm than good. He would ask me if I would answer for you, and I should reply that you are one of those noblemen who stand in need of no surety. All the same, the landlord would think that if I did not stand your surety, it must be from my entertaining doubts as to your solvency. \" I had introduced Fraiture to Count Manucci, on the Pando, and he requested me to take him to see the count, to which request I was foolish enough to accede. A few days later the baron opened his soul to Manucci.',\n",
       " 'He found the Venetian disposed to be obliging, but wary. He refused to lend money himself, but introduced the baron to someone who lent him money on pledges without interest. The baron and his friend did a little gaming and won a little money, but I held aloof from them to the best of my ability. I had my colony and Donna Ignazia, and wanted to live peacefully; and if I had spent a single night away from home, the innocent girl would have been filled with alarm. de Mocenigo went as ambassador to France, and was replaced by M. Querini was a man of letters, while Mocenigo only liked music and his own peculiar kind of love. The new ambassador was distinctly favourable to me, and in a few days I had reason to believe that he would do more for me than ever Mocenigo would have done. In the meanwhile, the baron and his friend began to think of beating a retreat to France.',\n",
       " 'There was no gaming at the ambassador\\'s and no gaming at the Court; they must return to France, but they owed money to their landlord, and they wanted money for the journey. I could give them nothing, Manucci would give them nothing; we both pitied them, but our duty to ourselves made us cruel to everyone else. One morning Manucci came to see me in evident perturbation. For the last week I have refused to see the Baron Fraiture, as not being able to give him money, his presence only wearied me. He has written me a letter, in which he threatens to blow out his brains to–day if I will not lend him a hundred pistoles. \" \"He said the same thing to me three days ago; but I replied that I would bet two hundred pistoles that he would do nothing of the kind. This made him angry, and he proposed to fight a duel with me; but I declined on the plea that as he was a desperate man either he would have an advantage over me or I, over him. Give him the same answer, or, better still, no answer at all.',\n",
       " '\" I admired his generosity and agreed to carry out his commission. I called on the baron, who seemed rather uncomfortable when I walked in; but considering his position I was not at all surprised. I informed him that I was the bearer of a thousand francs from Count Manucci, who thereby placed him in a position to arrange his affairs and to leave Madrid. He received the money without any signs of pleasure, surprise, or gratitude, and wrote out the receipt. He assured me that he and his friend would start for Barcelona and France on the following day. I then took the document to Manucci, who was evidently suffering from some mental trouble; and I remained to dinner with the ambassador. Three days after I went to dine with the ambassadors (for they all dined together), but to my astonishment the porter told me that he had received orders not to admit me. The effect of this sentence on me was like that of a thunderbolt; I returned home like a man in a dream.',\n",
       " 'I immediately sat down and wrote to Manucci, asking him why I had been subjected to such an insult; but Philippe, my man, brought me back the letter unopened. This was another surprise; I did not know what to expect next. \"I cannot imagine, but I will have an explanation, or perish. \" I dined sadly with Donna Ignazia, without telling her the cause of my trouble, and just as I was going to take my siesta a servant of Manucci\\'s brought me a letter from his master and fled before I could read it. The letter contained an enclosure which I read first. He asked Manucci to lend him a hundred pistoles, promising to shew him the man whom he held for his dearest friend to be his worst enemy. Manucci (honouring me, by the way, with the title of ungrateful traitor) said that the baron\\'s letter had excited his curiosity and he had met him in St.',\n",
       " \"Jerome's Park, where the baron had clearly proved this enemy to be myself, since I had informed the baron that though the name of Manucci was genuine the title of count was quite apocryphal. After recapitulating the information which Fraiture had given him, and which could only have proceeded from myself, he advised me to leave Madrid as soon as possible, in a week at latest. I can give the reader no idea of the shock this letter gave me. For the first time in my life I had to confess myself guilty of folly, ingratitude, and crime. I felt that my fault was beyond forgiveness, and did not think of asking Manucci to pardon me; I could do nothing but despair. Nevertheless, in spite of Manucci's just indignation, I could not help seeing that he had made a great mistake in advising me, in so insulting a manner, to leave Madrid in a week. The young man might have known that my self–respect would forbid my following such a piece of advice.\",\n",
       " 'He could not compel me to obey his counsel or command; and to leave Madrid would have been to commit a second baseness worse than the first. A prey to grief I spent the day without taking any steps one way or the other, and I went to bed without supping and without the company of Donna Ignazia. After a sound sleep I got up and wrote to the friend whom I had offended a sincere and humble confession of my fault. I concluded my letter by saying that I hoped that this evidence of my sincere and heartfelt repentance would suffice, but if not that I was ready to give him any honourable satisfaction in my power. \"You may,\" I said, \"have me assassinated if you like, but I shall not leave Madrid till its suits me to do so. \" I put a commonplace seal on my letter, and had the address written by Philippe, whose hand was unknown to Manucci, and then I sent it to Pando where the king had gone.',\n",
       " 'I kept my room the whole day; and Donna Ignazia, seeing that I had recovered my spirits to some degree, made no more enquiries about the cause of my distress. I waited in the whole of the next day, expecting a reply, but in vain. The third day, being Sunday, I went out to call on the Prince della Catolica. My carriage stopped at his door, but the porter came out and told me in a polite whisper that his highness had his reasons for not receiving me any longer. This was an unexpected blow, but after it I was prepared for anything. I drove to the Abbe Bigliardi, but the lackey, after taking in my name, informed me that his master was out. I got into my carriage and went to Varnier, who said he wanted to speak to me. \"Come into my carriage,\" said I, \"we will go and hear mass together. \" On our way he told me that the Venetian ambassador, Mocenigo, had warned the Duke of Medina Sidonia that I was a dangerous character.',\n",
       " '\"The duke,\" he added, \"replied that he would cease to know you as soon as he found out the badness of your character himself. \" These three shocks, following in such quick succession, cast me into a state of confusion. I said nothing till we heard mass together, but I believe that if I had not then told him the whole story I should have had an apoplectic fit. Varnier pitied me, and said,— \"Such are the ways of the great when they have abjured all virtue and honesty. Nevertheless, I advise you to keep silence about it, unless you would irritate Manucci still farther. \" When I got home I wrote to Manucci begging him to suspend his vengeance, or else I should be obliged to tell the story to all those who insulted me for the ambassador\\'s sake. Soderini, the secretary of the embassy, feeling sure that he would forward it to Manucci.',\n",
       " 'I dined with my mistress, and took her to the bull fight, where I chanced to find myself in a box adjoining that in which Manucci and the two ambassadors were seated. I made them a bow which they were obliged to return, and did not vouchsafe them another glance for the rest of the spectacle. The next day the Marquis Grimaldi refused to receive me, and I saw that I should have to abandon all hope. The Duke of Lossada remained my friend on account of his dislike to the ambassador and his unnatural tastes; but he told me that he had been requested not to receive me, and that he did not think I had the slightest chance of obtaining any employment at Court. I could scarcely believe in such an extremity of vengeance: Manucci was making a parade of the influence he possessed over his wife the ambassador. In his insane desire for revenge he had laid all shame aside.',\n",
       " 'I was curious to know whether he had forgotten Don Emmanuel de Roda and the Marquis de la Moras; I found both of them had been forewarned against me. There was still the Count of Aranda, and I was just going to see him when a servant of his highness\\'s came and told me that his master wished to see me. I shuddered, for in my then state of mind I drew the most sinister conclusions from the message. I found the great man alone, looking perfectly calm. He asked me to sit down—a favour he had not hitherto done me, and this further contributed to cheer me. \"What have you been doing to offend your ambassador?\" he began. \"My lord, I have done nothing to him directly, but by an inexcusable act of stupidity I have wounded his dear friend Manucci in his tenderest part. With the most innocent intentions I reposed my confidence in a cowardly fellow, who sold it to Manucci for a hundred pistoles. In his irritation, Manucci has stirred up the great man against me: \\'hinc illae lacrimae\\'.',\n",
       " 'I am sorry for you, because there is an end to all your hopes of advancement. The first thing the king would do would be to make enquiries about you of the ambassador. \" \"I feel it to my sorrow, my lord, but must I leave Madrid?\" \"No. The ambassador did his best to make me send you way, but I told him that I had no power over you so long as you did not infringe the laws. \" \"\\'He has calumniated a Venetian subject whom I am bound to protect,\\' said he. \"\\'In that case,\\' I replied, \\'you can resort to the ordinary law, and punish him to the best of your ability. \\'\" \"The ambassador finally begged me to order you not to mention the matter to any Venetian subjects at Madrid, and I think you can safely promise me this. \" \"My lord, I have much pleasure in giving your excellency my word of honour not to do so. Then you can stay at Madrid as long as you please; and, indeed, Mocenigo will be leaving in the course of a week.',\n",
       " '\" From that moment I made up my mind to amuse myself without any thought of obtaining a position in Spain. However, the ties of friendship made me keep up my acquaintance with Varnier, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, and the architect, Sabatini, who always gave me a warm welcome, as did his wife. Donna Ignazia had more of my company than ever, and congratulated me on my freedom from the cares of business. After the departure of Mocenigo I thought I would go and see if Querini, his nephew, was equally prejudiced against me. The porter told me that he had received orders not to admit me, and I laughed in the man\\'s face. Six or seven weeks after Manucci\\'s departure I, too, left Madrid. I did so on compulsion, in spite of my love for Ignazia, for I had no longer hopes of doing anything in Portugal, and my purse was nearly exhausted.',\n",
       " 'I thought of selling a handsome repeater and a gold snuff–box so as to enable me to go to Marseilles, whence I thought of going to Constantinople and trying my fortune there without turning renegade. Doubtless, I should have found the plan unsuccessful, for I was attaining an age when Fortune flies. I had no reason, however, to complain of Fortune, for she had been lavish in her gifts to me, and I in my turn had always abused them. In my state of distress the learned Abbe Pinzi introduced me to a Genoese bookseller, named Carrado, a thoroughly honest man, who seemed to have been created that the knavery of most of the Genoese might be pardoned. To him I brought my watch and snuff–box, but the worthy Carrado not only refused to buy them, but would not take them in pledge. He gave me seventeen hundred francs with no other security than my word that I would repay him if I were ever able to do so.',\n",
       " 'Unhappily I have never been able to repay this debt, unless my gratitude be accounted repayment. As nothing is sweeter than the companionship between a man and the woman he adores, so nothing is bitterer than the separation; the pleasure has vanished away, and only the pain remains. I spent my last days at Madrid drinking the cup of pleasure which was embittered by the thought of the pain that was to follow. The worthy Diego was sad at the thought of losing me, and could with difficulty refrain from tears. For some time my man Philippe continued to give me news of Donna Ignazia. She became the bride of a rich shoemaker, though her father was extremely mortified by her making a marriage so much beneath her station. I had promised the Marquis de las Moras and Colonel Royas that I would come and see them at Saragossa, the capital of Aragon, and I arrived there at the beginning of September.',\n",
       " 'My stay lasted for a fortnight, during which time I was able to examine the manners and customs of the Aragonese, who were not subject to the ordinances of the Marquis of Aranda, as long cloaks and low hats were to be seen at every corner. They looked like dark phantoms more than men, for the cloak covered up at least half the face. Underneath the cloak was carried el Spadino, a sword of enormous length. Persons who wore this costume were treated with great respect, though they were mostly arrant rogues; still they might possibly be powerful noblemen in disguise. The visitor to Saragossa should see the devotion which is paid to our Lady del Pilar. I have seen processions going along the streets in which wooden statues of gigantic proportions were carried. I was taken to the best assemblies, where the monks swarmed. I was introduced to a lady of monstrous size, who, I was informed, was cousin to the famous Palafox, and I did not feel my bosom swell with pride as was evidently expected.',\n",
       " 'I also made the acquaintance of Canon Pignatelli, a man of Italian origin. He was President of the Inquisition, and every morning he imprisoned the procuress who had furnished him with the girl with whom he had supped and slept. He would wake up in the morning tired out with the pleasures of the night; the girl would be driven away and the procuress imprisoned. He then dressed, confessed, said mass, and after an excellent breakfast with plenty of good wine he would send out for another girl, and this would go on day after day. Nevertheless, he was held in great respect at Saragossa, for he was a monk, a canon, and an Inquisitor. The bull fights were finer at Saragossa than at Madrid—that is to say, they were deadlier; and the chief interest of this barbarous spectacle lies in the shedding of blood. The Marquis de las Moras and Colonel Royas gave me some excellent dinners. The marquis was one of the pleasantest men I met in Spain; he died very young two years after.',\n",
       " 'The Church of Nuestra Senora del Pilar is situated on the ramparts of the town, and the Aragonese fondly believe this portion of the town defences to be impregnable. I had promised Donna Pelliccia to go and see her at Valentia, and on my way I saw the ancient town of Saguntum on a hill at some little distance. There was a priest travelling with me and I told him and the driver (who preferred his mules to all the antiquities in the world) that I should like to go and see the town. How the muleteer and the priest objected to this proposal! \"There are only ruins there, senor. \" The crown settled everything, and the man exclaimed, \"Valga me Dios, es un hombre de buen!\" (So help me God, this is an honest man!) A subject of his Catholic majesty knows no heartier praise than this. I saw the massive walls still standing and in good condition, and yet they were built during the second Punic War.',\n",
       " 'I saw on two of the gateways inscriptions which to me were meaningless, but which Seguier, the old friend of the Marquis Maffei, could no doubt have deciphered. The sight of this monument to the courage of an ancient race, who preferred to perish in the flames rather than surrender, excited my awe and admiration. The priest laughed at me, and I am sure he would not have purchased this venerable city of the dead if he could have done so by saying a mass. The very name has perished; instead of Saguntum it is called Murviedro from the Latin \\'muri veteres\\' (old walls); but Time that destroys marble and brass destroys also the very memory of what has been. \"This place,\" said the priest, \"is always called Murviedro. \" \"It is ridiculous to do so,\" I replied; \"common sense forbids us calling a thing old which was once young enough. That\\'s as if you would tell me that New Castille is really new. \" \"Well, Old Castille is more ancient than New Castille.',\n",
       " 'New Castille was only called so because it was the latest conquest; but as a matter of fact it is the older of the two. \" The poor priest took refuge in silence; shaking his head, and evidently taking me for a madman. I tried vainly to find Hannibal\\'s head, and the inscription in honour of Caesar Claudius, but I found out the remains of the amphitheatre. The next day I remarked the mosaic pavement, which had been discovered twenty years before. I reached Valentia at nine o\\'clock in the morning, and found that I should have to content myself with a bad lodging, as Marescalchi, the opera manager, had taken all the best rooms for the members of his company. Marescalchi was accompanied by his brother, a priest, whom I found decidedly learned for his age. We took a walk together, and he laughed when I proposed going into a cafe, for there was not such a thing in the town. There were only taverns of the lowest class where the wine is not fit to drink.',\n",
       " 'I could scarcely believe it, but Spain is a peculiar country. When I was at Valentia, a good bottle of wine was scarcely obtainable, though Malaga and Alicante were both close at hand. In the first three days of my stay at Valentia (the birthplace of Alexander VI. ), I saw all the objects of interest in the town, and was confirmed in my idea that what seems so admirable in the descriptions of writers and the pictures of artists loses much of its charm on actual inspection. Though Valentia is blessed with an excellent climate, though it is well watered, situated in the midst of a beautiful country, fertile in all the choicest products of nature, though it is the residence of many of the most distinguished of the Spanish nobility, though its women are the most handsome in Spain, though it has the advantage of being the seat of an archbishop; in spite of all these commodities, it is a most disagreeable town to live in.',\n",
       " \"One is ill lodged and ill fed, there is no good wine and no good company, there is not even any intellectual provision, for though there is a university, lettered men are absolutely unknown. As for the bridges, churches, the arsenal, the exchange, the town hall, the twelve town gates, and the rest, I could not take pleasure in a town where the streets are not paved, and where a public promenade is conspicuous by its absence. Outside the town the country is delightful, especially on the side towards the sea; but the outside is not the inside. The feature which pleased me most was the number of small one–horse vehicles which transport the traveller rapidly from one point to another, at a very slight expense, and will even undertake a two or three days' journey. If my frame of mind had been a more pleasant one, I should have travelled through the kingdoms of Murcia and Grenada, which surpass Italy in beauty and fertility.\",\n",
       " 'Poor Spaniards! This beauty and fertility of your land are the cause of your ignorance, as the mines of Peru and Potosi have brought about that foolish pride and all the prejudices which degrade you. Spaniards, when will the impulse come? when will you shake off that fatal lethargy? Now you are truly useless to yourselves, and the rest of the world; what is it you need? A furious revolution, a terrible shock, a conquest of regeneration; your case is past gentle methods, it needs the cautery and the fire. This was not a matter of any difficulty, as the same operas were to be presented as had been already played at Aranjuez, the Escurial, and the Granja, for the Count of Aranda would never have dared to sanction the performance of an Italian comic opera at Madrid. The novelty would have been too great, and the Inquisition would have interfered. The balls were a considerable shock, and two years after they were suppressed.',\n",
       " 'Spain will never make any real advance, until the Inquisition is suppressed also. As soon as Donna Pelliccia arrived, she sent in the letter of introduction she had received from the Duke of Arcos, three months before. She had not seen the duke since their meeting at Aranjuez. \"Madam,\" said Don Diego, the person to whom she was commended, \"I have come to offer you my services, and to tell you of the orders his grace has laid on me, of which you may possibly be ignorant. \" \"I hope, sir,\" she replied, \"that I am not putting you to any inconvenience, but I am extremely grateful to the duke and to yourself; and I shall have the honour of calling on you to give you my thanks. \" \"Not at all; I have only to say that I have orders to furnish you with any sums you may require, to the amount of twenty–five thousand doubloons. \" \"Twenty–five thousand doubloons?\" \"Exactly, madam, two hundred and fifty thousand francs in French money, and no more.',\n",
       " 'Kindly read his grace\\'s letter; you do not seem to be aware of its contents. \" The letter was a brief one: \"Don Diego,—You will furnish Donna Pelliccia with whatever sums she may require, not exceeding twenty–five thousand doubloons, at my account. \"THE DUKE DOS ARCOS\" We remained in a state of perfect stupefaction. Donna Pelliccia returned the epistle to the banker, who bowed and took his leave. This sounds almost incredible generosity, but in Spain such things are not uncommon. I have already mentioned the munificent gift of Medina– Celi to Madame Pichona. Those who are unacquainted with the peculiar Spanish character and the vast riches of some of the nobility, may pronounce such acts of generosity to be ridiculous and positively injurious, but they make a mistake. The spendthrift gives and squanders by a kind of instinct, and so he will continue to do as long as his means remain. But these splendid gifts I have described do not come under the category of senseless prodigality.',\n",
       " 'The Spaniard is chiefly ambitious of praise, for praise he will do anything; but this very desire for admiration serves to restrain him from actions by which he would incur blame. He wants to be thought superior to his fellows, as the Spanish nation is superior to all other nations; he wants to be thought worthy of a throne, and to be considered as the possessor of all the virtues. I may also note that while some of the Spanish nobility are as rich as the English lords, the former have not so many ways of spending their money as the latter, and thus are enabled to be heroically generous on occasion. As soon as Don Diego had gone, we began to discuss the duke\\'s noble behaviour. Donna Pelliccia maintained that the duke had wished to shew his confidence in her by doing her the honour of supposing her incapable of abusing his generosity; \"at all events,\" she concluded, \"I would rather die of hunger than take a single doubloon of Don Diego.',\n",
       " '\" \"The duke would be offended,\" said a violinist; \"I think you ought to take something. I was of the lady\\'s opinion, and told her that I was sure the duke would reward her delicacy by making her fortune. She followed my advice and her own impulse, though the banker remonstrated with her. Such is the perversity of the human mind that no one believed in Donna Pelliccia\\'s delicacy. When the king heard what had happened he ordered the worthy actress to leave Madrid, to prevent the duke ruining himself. Such is often the reward of virtue here below, but the malicious persons who had tried to injure Donna Pelliccia by calumniating her to the king were the means of making her fortune. The duke who had only spoken once or twice to the actress in public, and had never spent a penny on her, took the king\\'s command as an insult, and one not to be borne. He was too proud to solicit the king to revoke the order he had given, and in the end behaved in a way befitting so noble–minded a man.',\n",
       " 'For the first time he visited Donna Pelliccia at her own house, and begging her to forgive him for having been the innocent cause of her disgrace, asked her to accept a rouleau and a letter which he laid on the table. The rouleau contained a hundred gold ounces with the words \"for travelling expenses,\" and the letter was addressed to a Roman bank, and proved to be an order for twenty–four thousand Roman crowns. For twenty–nine years this worthy woman kept an establishment at Rome, and did so in a manner which proved her worthy of her good fortune. The day after Donna Pelliccia\\'s departure the king saw the Duke of Arcos, and told him not to be sad, but to forget the woman, who had been sent away for his own good. \"By sending her away, your majesty obliged me to turn fiction into fact, for I only knew her by speaking to her in various public places, and I had never made her the smallest present.',\n",
       " '\" \"Then you never gave her twenty–five thousand doubloons?\" \"Sire, I gave her double that sum, but only on the day before yesterday. Your majesty has absolute power, but if she had not received her dismissal I should never have gone to her house, nor should I have given her the smallest present. \" The king was stupefied and silent; he was probably meditating on the amount of credit a monarch should give to the gossip that his courtiers bring him. Monnino, who was afterwards known under the title of Castille de Florida Blanca, and is now living in exile in Murcia, his native country. After Marescalchi had gone, and I was making my preparations for my journey to Barcelona, I saw one day, at the bull fight, a woman whose appearance had a strange kind of fascination about it. There was a knight of Alcantara at my side, and I asked him who the lady was. \" \"How famous?\" \"If you do not know her story, it is too long to be told here.',\n",
       " '\" I could not help gazing at her, and two minutes later an ill–looking fellow beside her came up to my companion and whispered something in his ear. The knight turned towards me and informed me in the most polite manner that the lady whose name I had asked desired to know mine. I was silly enough to be flattered by her curiosity, and told the messenger that if the lady would allow me I would come to her box and tell her my name in person after the performance. \"From your accent I should suppose you were an Italian. \" When he had gone away my neighbour seemed inclined to be more communicative, and informed me that Nina was a dancer whom the Count de Ricla, the Viceroy of Barcelona, was keeping for some weeks at Valentia, till he could get her back to Barcelona, whence the bishop of the diocese had expelled her on account of the scandals to which she gave rise. \"The count,\" he added, \"is madly in love with her, and allows her fifty doubloons a day.',\n",
       " '\" \"She can\\'t do that, but she does not let a day pass without committing some expensive act of folly. \" I felt curious to know a woman of such a peculiar character, and longed for the end of the bull fight, little thinking in what trouble this new acquaintance would involve me. She received me with great politeness, and as she got into her carriage drawn by six mules, she said she would be delighted if I would breakfast with her at nine o\\'clock on the following day. Her house was just outside the town walls, and was a very large building. It was richly and tastefully furnished, and was surrounded by an enormous garden. The first thing that struck me was the number of the lackeys and the richness of their liveries, and the maids in elegant attire, who seemed to be going and coming in all directions. As I advanced I heard an imperious voice scolding some one. The scold was Nina, who was abusing an astonished–looking man, who was standing by a large table covered with stuffs and laces.',\n",
       " '\"Excuse me,\" said she, \"but this fool of a Spaniard wants to persuade me that this lace is really handsome. \" She asked me what I thought of the lace, and though I privately thought it lace of the finest quality, I did not care to contradict her, and so replied that I was no judge. \"Madam,\" said the tradesman, \"if you do not like the lace, leave it; will you keep the stuffs?\" \"Yes,\" she replied; \"and as for the lace, I will shew you that it is not the money that deters me. \" So saying the mad girl took up a pair of scissors and cut the lace into fragments. \"What a pity!\" said the man who had spoken to me at the bull fight. \" \"Be silent, you pimping rogue!\" said she, enforcing her words with a sturdy box on the ear. The fellow went off, calling her strumpet, which only made her scream with laughter; then, turning to the Spaniard, she told him to make out his account directly.',\n",
       " 'The man did not want telling twice, and avenged himself for the abuse he had received by the inordinate length of his bill. She took up the account and placed her initials at the bottom without deigning to look at the items, and said,— \"Go to Don Diego Valencia; he will pay you immediately. \" As soon as we were alone the chocolate was served, and she sent a message to the fellow whose ears she had boxed to come to breakfast directly. \"You needn\\'t be surprised at my way of treating him,\" she said. \"He\\'s a rascal whom Ricla has placed in my house to spy out my actions, and I treat him as you have seen, so that he may have plenty of news to write to his master. \" I thought I must be dreaming; such a woman seemed to me beyond the limits of the possible. The poor wretch, who came from Bologna and was a musician by profession, came and sat down with us without a word.',\n",
       " 'As soon as he had finished his breakfast he left the room, and Nina spent an hour with me talking about Spain, Italy, and Portugal, where she had married a dancer named Bergonzi. \"My father,\" she said, \"was the famous charlatan Pelandi; you may have known him at Venice. \" After this piece of confidence (and she did not seem at all ashamed of her parentage) she asked me to sup with her, supper being her favourite meal. I promised to come, and I left her to reflect on the extraordinary character of the woman, and on the good fortune which she so abused. Nina was wonderfully beautiful; but as it has always been my opinion that mere beauty does not go for much, I could not understand how a viceroy could have fallen in love with her to such an extent. As for Molinari, after which I had seen, I could only set him down as an infamous wretch. I went to supper with her for amusement\\'s sake, for, with all her beauty, she had not touched my heart in the slightest degree.',\n",
       " 'It was at the beginning of October, but at Valentia the thermometer marked twenty degrees Reaumur in the shade. Nina was walking in the garden with her companion, both of them being very lightly clad; indeed, Nina had only her chemise and a light petticoat. As soon as she saw me she came up and begged me to follow their example in the way of attire, but I begged to be excused. The presence of that hateful fellow revolted me in the highest degree. In the interval before supper Nina entertained me with a number of lascivious anecdotes of her experiences from the time she began her present mode of living up to the age of twenty–two, which was her age then. If it had not been for the presence of the disgusting Argus, no doubt all these stories would have produced their natural effect on me; but as it was they had none whatever. We had a delicate supper and ate with appetite, and after it was over I would have gladly left them; but Nina would not let me go.',\n",
       " \"The wine had taken effect, and she wished to have a little amusement. After all the servants had been dismissed, this Messalina ordered Molinari to strip naked, and she then began to treat him in a manner which I cannot describe without disgust. The rascal was young and strong, and, though he was drunk, Nina's treatment soon placed him in a hearty condition. I could see that she wished me to play my part in the revels, but my disgust had utterly deprived me of all my amorous faculties. Nina, too, had undressed, and seeing that I viewed the orgy coldly she proceeded to satiate her desires by means of Molinari. I had to bear with the sight of this beautiful woman coupling herself with an animal, whose only merit lay in his virile monstrosity, which she no doubt regarded as a beauty. When she had exhausted her amorous fury she threw herself into a bath, then came back, drank a bottle of Malmsey Madeira, and finally made her brutal lover drink till he fell on to the floor.\",\n",
       " 'I fled into the next room, not being able to bear it any longer, but she followed me. She was still naked, and seating herself beside me on an ottoman she asked me how I had enjoyed the spectacle. I told her boldy that the disgust with which her wretched companion had inspired me was so great that it had utterly annulled the effect of her charms. \"That may be so, but now he is not here, and yet you do nothing. \" \"You are right, for I have my feelings like any other man, but he has disgusted me too much. Wait till tomorrow, and let me not see that monster so unworthy of enjoying you. If I thought he did I would rather die than let him have to do with me, for I detest him. \" \"What! you do not love him, and yet you make use of him in the way you do?\" \"Yes, just as I might use a mechanical instrument. \" In this woman I saw an instance of the depths of degradation to which human nature may be brought.',\n",
       " 'She asked me to sup with her on the following day, telling me that we would be alone, as Molinari would be ill. \" \"You will not go for a week, and then we will go together. \" I went home with my mind made up to depart without having anything more to do with her; and though I was far from inexperienced in wickedness of all kinds, I could not help feeling astonished at the unblushing frankness of this Megaera, who had told me what I already knew, but in words that I had never heard a woman use before. \"I only use him to satisfy my desires, and because I am certain that he does not love me; if I thought he did I would rather die than allow him to do anything with me, for I detest him. \" The next day I went to her at seven o\\'clock in the evening. She received me with an air of feigned melancholy, saying,— \"Alas! we shall have to sup alone; Molinari has got the colic. \" \"You said he would be ill; have you poisoned him?\" \"I am quite capable of doing so, but I hope I never shall.',\n",
       " '\" \"But you have given him something?\" \"Only what he likes himself; but we will talk of that again. Let us sup and play till to–morrow, and tomorrow evening we will begin again. \" \"No, no, you are not; and your coachman will have no cause for complaint, for he has been paid; here is the receipt. \" These remarks, delivered with an air of amorous despotism, flattered my vanity. I made up my mind to submit gaily, called her wanton, and said I was not worth the pains she was taking over me. \"What astonishes me,\" said I, \"is that with this fine house you do not care to entertain company. \" \"Everybody is afraid to come; they fear Ricla\\'s jealousy, for it is well known that that animal who is now suffering from the colic tells him everything I do. He swears that it is not so, but I know him to be a liar. Indeed, I am very glad he does write to Ricla, and only wish he had something of real importance to write about. \" \"He will tell him that I have supped alone with you.',\n",
       " '\" \"All the better; are you afraid?\" \"No; but I think you ought to tell me if I have anything really to fear. \" \"But I should not like to involve you in a dispute which might be prejudicial to your interests. \" \"Not at all; the more I provoke him, the better he loves me, and I will make him pay dearly when he asks me to make it up. \" \"Then you don\\'t love him?\" \"Yes, to ruin him; but he is so rich that there doesn\\'t seem much hope of my ever doing that. \" Before me I saw a woman as beautiful as Venus and as degraded as Lucifer; a woman most surely born to be the ruin of anyone who had the misfortune to fall in love with her. I had known women of similar character, but never one so dangerous as she. I determined to make some money out of her if I could. She called for cards, and asked me to play with her at a game called primiera. It is a game of chance, but of so complicated a nature that the best player always wins.',\n",
       " 'In a quarter of an hour I found that I was the better player, but she had such luck that at the end of the game I had lost twenty pistoles, which I paid on the spot. She took the money, promising to give me my revenge. We had supper, and then we committed all the wantonness she wished and I was capable of performing, for with me the age of miracles was past. The next day I called to see her earlier in the evening. We played again; and she lost, and went on losing evening after evening, till I had won a matter of two or three hundred doubloons, no unwelcome addition to my somewhat depleted purse. The spy recovered from his colic and supped with us every evening, but his presence no longer interfered with my pleasure since Nina had ceased to prostitute herself to him in my presence. She did the opposite; giving herself to me, and telling him to write to the Comte de Ricla whatever he liked. The count wrote her a letter which she gave me to read.',\n",
       " \"The poor love– sick viceroy informed her that she might safely return to Barcelona, as the bishop had received an order from the Court to regard her as merely au actress, whose stay in his diocese would only be temporary; she would thus be allowed to live there in peace so long as she abstained from giving cause for scandal. She told me that whilst she was at Barcelona I could only see her after ten o'clock at night, when the count always left her. Possibly I should not have stayed at Barcelona at all if Nina had not told me that she would always be ready to lend me as much money as I wanted. She asked me to leave Valentia a day before her, and to await her at Tarragona. I did so, and spent a very pleasant day in that town, which abounds in remains of antiquity. I ordered a choice supper according to her instructions, and took care that she should have a separate bedroom so as to avoid any scandal.\",\n",
       " 'She started in the morning begging me to wait till the evening, and to travel by night so as to reach Barcelona by day–time. She told me to put up at the \"Santa Maria,\" and not to call till I had heard from her. I followed all the directions given me by this curious woman, and found myself comfortably lodged at Barcelona. My landlord was a Swiss who told me in confidence that he had received instructions to treat me well, and that I had only to ask for what I wanted.',\n",
       " \"Chapter II My Imprudence--passano--I Am Imprisoned--my Departure From Barcelona-- Madame Castelbajac at Montpellier--nimes--i Arrive at Aix Although my Swiss landlord seemed an honest and trustworthy kind of man, I could not help thinking that Nina had acted very imprudently in commending me to him. She was the viceroy's mistress; and though the viceroy might be a very agreeable man, he was a Spaniard, and not likely to be easy–going in his love affairs. Nina herself had told me that he was ardent, jealous, and suspicious. But the mischief was done, and there was no help for it. When I got up my landlord brought me a valet de place, for whose character he said he could answer, and he then sent up an excellent dinner. After dinner I summoned my host, and asked him whether Nina had told him to get me a servant. He answered in the affirmative, and added that a carriage was awaiting my commands at the door; it had been taken by the week.\",\n",
       " '\"I am astonished to hear it, for no one but myself can say what I can afford or not. \" \"Paid for! I will not have it!\" \"You can settle that with her, but I shall certainly take no payment. \" I saw dangers ahead, but as I have never cared to cherish forbodings I dismissed the idea. I had a letter of introduction from the Marquis de las Moras to Don Miguel de Cevallos, and another from Colonel Royas to Don Diego de la Secada. I took my letters, and the next day Don Diego came to see me, and took me to the Comte de Peralda. The day after Don Miguel introduced me to the Comte de Ricla, Viceroy of Catalonia, and the lover of Nina. The Comte de Peralada was a young man with a pleasant face but with an ill–proportioned body. He was a great debauchee and lover of bad company, an enemy of religion, morality, and law. He was directly descended from the Comte de Peralada, who served Philip II. so well that this king declared him \"count by the grace of God.',\n",
       " '\" The original patent of nobility was the first thing I saw in his antechamber, where it was framed and glazed so that all visitors might see it in the quarter of an hour they were kept waiting. The count received me with an easy and cordiale manner, which seemed to say that he renounced all the dignities of his rank. He thanked Don Diego for introducing me, and talked a good deal about Colonel Royas. He asked me if I had seen the English girl he was keeping at Saragossa, and on my replying in the affirmative, he told me in a whisper that he had slept with her. He took me to his stables, where he had some splendid horses, and then asked me to dine with him the next day.',\n",
       " \"The viceroy received me in a very different manner; he stood up so that he might not have to offer me a chair, and though I spoke Italian, with which language I knew him to be well acquainted, he answered me in Spanish, styling me 'ussia' (a contraction of 'vuestra senoria', your lordship, and used by everyone in Spain), while I gave him his proper title of excellence. He talked a good deal about Madrid, and complained that M. de Mocenigo had gone to Paris by Bayonne instead of Barcelona, as he had promised him. I tried to excuse my ambassador by saying that by taking the other route he had saved fifty leagues of his journey, but the viceroy replied that 'tenir la palabra' (keeping to one's words) comes before all else. He asked me if I thought of staying long at Barcelona, and seemed surprised when I told him that, with his leave, I hoped to make a long stay.\",\n",
       " '\"I hope you will enjoy yourself,\" he said, \"but I must warn you that if you indulge in the pleasures which my nephew Peralada will doubtless offer you, you will not enjoy a very good reputation at Barcelona. \" As the Comte de Ricla made this observation in public, I thought myself justified in communicating it to Peralada himself. He was delighted, and told me, with evident vanity, that he had gone to Madrid three times, and had been ordered to return to Catalonia on each occasion. I thought my best plan would be to follow the viceroy\\'s indirect advice, so I refused to join in any of the little parties of pleasure which Peralada proposed. On the fifth day after my arrival, an officer came to ask me to dinner at the viceroy\\'s. I accepted the invitation with much pleasure, for I had been afraid of the viceroy\\'s having heard of my relations with Nina, and thought it possible that he might have taken a dislike to me.',\n",
       " \"He was very pleasant to me at dinner, often addressing his observations to me, but always in a tone of great gravity. I had been in Barcelona for a week, and was beginning to wonder why I had not heard from Nina; but one evening she wrote me a note, begging me to come on foot and alone to her house at ten o'clock the same night. If I had been wise I should not have gone, for I was not in love with the woman, and should have remembered the respect due to the viceroy; but I was devoid of all wisdom and prudence. All the misfortunes I have experienced in my long life never taught me those two most necessary virtues. At the hour she had named I called on her, wearing my great coat, and with a sword for my only weapon. I found Nina with her sister, a woman of thirty–six or thereabouts, who was married to an Italian dancer, nicknamed Schizza, because he had a flatter nose than any Tartar.\",\n",
       " 'Nina had just been supping with her lover, who had left her at ten o\\'clock, according to his invariable custom. She said she was delighted to hear I had been to dinner with him, as she had herself spoken to him in my praise, saying how admirably I had kept her company at Valentia. \"I am glad to hear it, but I do not think you are wise in inviting me to your house at such late hours. \" \"I only do so to avoid scandal amongst my neighbours. \" \"In my opinion my coming so late is only likely to increase the probability of scandal, and to make your viceroy jealous. \" I went away at midnight, after a conversation of the most decent character. Her sister did not leave us for a moment, and Nina gave her no cause to suspect the intimacy of our relations. I went to see her every evening, without encroaching on the count\\'s preserves. I thought myself secure, but the following warning should have made me desist if I had not been carried away by the forces of destiny and obstinacy in combination.',\n",
       " 'An officer in the Walloon Guards accosted me one day as I was walking by myself just outside the town. He begged me in the most polite manner to excuse him if he spoke on a matter which was indifferent to him but of great consequence to me. \"Speak, sir,\" I replied, \"I will take whatever you say in good part. You are a stranger, sir, and may not be acquainted with our Spanish manners, consequently you are unaware of the great risk you run in going to see Nina every evening after the count has left her. \" \"What risk do I run? I have no doubt that the count knows all about it and does not object. \" \"I have no doubt as to his knowing it, and he may possibly pretend to know nothing before her, as he fears as well as loves her; but if she tells you that he does not object, she either deceives herself or you. He cannot love her without being jealous, and a jealous Spaniard … \"Follow my advice, sir, and forgive my freedom.',\n",
       " '\" \"I am sincerely obliged to you for your kind interest in me, but I cannot follow your advice, as by doing so I should be wanting in politeness to Nina, who likes to see me and gives me a warm welcome. I shall continue to visit her till she orders me not to do so, or till the count signifies to me his displeasure at my visits to his mistress. \" \"The count will never do such a thing; he is too careful of his dignity. \" The worthy officer then narrated to me all the acts of injustice which Ricla had committed since he had fallen in love with this woman. He had dismissed gentlemen from his service on the mere suspicion that they were in love with her; some had been exiled, and others imprisoned on one frivolous pretext or another. Before he had known Nina he had been a pattern of wisdom, justice, and virtue, and now he had become unjust, cruel, blindly passionate, and in every way a scandal to the high position he occupied.',\n",
       " 'All this should have influenced me, but it had not the slightest effect. I told him for politeness\\' sake that I would endeavour to part from her by degrees, but I had no intention of doing so. When I asked him how he knew that I visited Nina, he laughed and said it was a common topic of conversation all over the town. The same evening I called on her without mentioning my conversation with the officer. There would have been some excuse for me if I had been in love with her, but as it was … I acted like a madman. On the 14th of November I went to see her at the usual time. I found her with a man who was shewing her miniatures. I looked at him and found that he was the scoundrel Passano, or Pogomas. My blood boiled; I took Nina\\'s hand and led her into a neighbouring room, and told her to dismiss the rogue at once, or I would go to return no more. \" \"I am well acquainted with his history, and will tell you all about it presently; but send him away, or I shall go.',\n",
       " '\" She called her sister, and told her to order the Genoese to leave the house and never to enter it again. The thing was \\'done in a moment, but the sister told us that as he went out he had said,— \"Se ne pentira. I occupied an hour in relating some of the injuries I had received from this scoundrelly fellow. The next day (November 15th), I went to Nina at the usual time, and after spending two hours in pleasant converse with her and her sister I went out as the clocks were striking midnight. The door of the house was under an arcade, which extended to the end of the street. It was a dark night; and I had scarcely gone twenty–five paces when two men suddenly rushed at me. I stepped back, drawing my sword, and exclaiming, \"Assassins!\" and then with a rapid movement, I thrust my blade into the body of the nearest assailant. I then left the arcade, and began to run down the street. The second assassin fired a pistol at me, but it fortunately missed me.',\n",
       " 'I fell down and dropped my hat in my rapid flight, and got up and continued my course without troubling to pick it up. I did not know whether I was wounded or not, but at last I got to my inn, and laid down the bloody sword on the counter, under the landlord\\'s nose. I told the landlord what had happened, and on taking off my great coat, I found it to be pierced in two places just below the armpit. \"I am going to bed,\" I said to the landlord, \"and I leave my great coat and the sword in your charge. Tomorrow morning I shall ask you to come with me before the magistrate to denounce this act of assassination, for if the man was killed it must be shewn that I only slew him to save my own life. \" \"I think your best plan would be to fly Barcelona immediately. \" \"Then you think I have not told you the strict truth?\" \"I am sure you have; but I know whence the blow comes, and God knows what will befall you!\" \"Nothing at all; but if I fly I shall be accounted guilty.',\n",
       " 'Take care of the sword; they tried to assassinate me, but I think the assassins got the worst of it. \" I went to bed somewhat perturbed, but I had the consoling thought that if I had killed a man I had done so to self–defence; my conscience was quite clear. At seven o\\'clock the next morning I heard a knocking at my door. I opened it, and saw my landlord, accompanied by an officer, who told me to give him all my papers, to dress, and to follow him, adding that he should be compelled to use force in case of resistance. \"By whose authority do you ask me for my papers?\" \"By the authority of the governor. They will be returned to you if nothing suspicious is found amongst them. \" \"Where are you going to take me?\" \"To the citadel. \" I opened my trunk, took out my linen and my clothes, which I gave to my landlord, and I saw the officer\\'s astonishment at seeing my trunk half filled with papers. \"I advise you, sir,\" he said, \"to put all necessary articles into a portmanteau.',\n",
       " '\" He then ordered the landlord to send me a bed, and finally asked me if I had any papers in my pockets. \" \"That\\'s exactly what we want,\" he rejoined, with a grim smile. \"My passports are sacred; I will never give them to anyone but the governor–general. Reverence your king; here is his passport, here is that of the Count of Aranda, and here the passport of the Venetian ambassador. You will have to bind me hand and foot before you get them. In giving them to me it is just as if you gave them to the viceroy. If you resist I will not bind you hand and foot, but I shall take you before the viceroy, and then you will be forced to give them up in public. Give them to me with a good grace, and you shall have an acknowledgement. \" The worthy landlord told me I should be wiser to give in, so I let myself be persuaded. The officer gave me a full quittance, which I put in my pocketbook (this he let me keep out of his kindness), and then I followed him.',\n",
       " 'He had six constables with him, but they kept a good distance away. Comparing this with the circumstances of my arrest at Madrid, I thought myself well treated. Before we left the inn the officer told me that I might order what meals I pleased, and I asked the landlord to let me have my dinner and supper as usual. On the way I told him of my adventure of the night before; he listened attentively but made no comments. When we reached the citadel I was delivered to the officer of the guard, who gave me a room on the first floor. It was bare of furniture, but the windows looked on to a square and had no iron bars. I had scarcely been there ten minutes when my carpet bag and an excellent bed were brought in. As soon as I was alone I began to think over the situation. \"What can this imprisonment have to do with my last night\\'s adventure?\" I reflected.',\n",
       " '\"They are bent on examining my papers; they must think I have been tampering in some political or religious intrigue; but my mind is quite at ease on that score. I am well lodged at present, and no doubt shall be set free after my papers have been examined; they can find nothing against me there. \"The affair of my attempted assassination will, no doubt, be considered separately. \"Even if the rascal is dead, I do not see what they can do to me. \"On the other hand, my landlord\\'s advice to fly from Barcelona looks ominous; what if the assassins received their orders from some person high in authority? \"It is possible that Ricla may have vowed my ruin, but it does not seem probable to me. \"Would it have been wise to follow the landlord\\'s advice? \"Possibly, but I do not think so; my honour would have suffered, and I might have been caught and laid up in some horrid dungeon, whereas for a prison I am comfortable enough here.',\n",
       " '\"In three or four days the examination of my papers will have been completed, and as there is nothing in them likely to be offensive to the powers that be, they will be returned to me with my liberty, which will taste all the sweeter for this short deprivation. \"I cannot think that the all–powerful hand of the viceroy could have directed the assassin\\'s sword; it would be a dishonour to him, and if it were so, he would not be treating me so kindly now. If it were his doing, he must have heard directly that the blow had failed, and in that case I do not think he would have arrested me this morning. \"Shall I write to Nina? Will writing be allowed here?\" As I was puzzling my brains with these reflections, stretched on my bed (for I had no chair), I heard some disturbance, and on opening my window I saw, to my great astonishment, Passano being brought into the prison by a corporal and two soldiers. As he was going in, the rascal looked up and saw me, and began to laugh.',\n",
       " '\"Alas!\" I said to myself, \"here is fresh food for conjecture. The fellow told Nina\\'s sister that I should be sorry for what I had done. He must have directed some fearful calumny against me, and they are imprisoning him so as to be sure of his evidence. \" On reflection, I was well pleased at the turn affairs had taken. An excellent dinner was set before me, but I had no chair or table. The deficiency was remedied by the soldier who was in charge of me for the consideration of a duro. Prisoners were not allowed to have pen and ink without special permission; but paper and pencils were not included under this regulation, so my guard got them for me, together with candles and candlesticks, and I proceeded to kill time by making geometrical calculations. I made the obliging soldier sup with me, and he promised to commend me to one of his comrades who would serve me well.',\n",
       " 'On the fourth day the officer of the guard came to me with a distressed look, and told me that he had the disagreeable duty of giving me some very bad news. \"What is that, sir?\" \"I have received orders to transfer you to the bottom of the tower. \" \"Then they must have discovered in me a criminal of the deepest dye! Let us go at once. \" I found myself in a kind of round cellar, paved with large flagstones, and lighted by five or six narrow slits in the walls. The officer told me I must order what food required to be brought once a day, as no one was allowed to come into the \\'calabozo\\', or dungeon, by night. \"How about lights?\" \"You may lave one lamp always burning, and that will be enough, as books are not allowed. When your dinner is brought, the officer on duty will open the pies and the poultry to see that they do not contain any documents; for here no letters are allowed to come in or go out. \" \"Have these orders been given for my especial benefit?\" \"No, sir; it is the ordinary rule.',\n",
       " '\" \"How about the cleanliness of my cell?\" \"A soldier will accompany the officer in charge of your dinner, and he will attend to your wants for a trifle. \" \"May I amuse myself by making architectural plans with the pencil?\" \"As much as you like. \" \"Then will you be good enough to order some paper to be bought for me?\" \"With pleasure. \" The officer seemed to pity me as he left me, and bolted and barred the heavy door behind which I saw a man standing sentry with his bayonet fixed. When I got my paper and my dinner at noonday the officer cut open a fowl, and plunged a fork in the other dishes so as to make sure that there were no papers at the bottom. I told the officer that I should be much honoured by his dining with me, but he replied that it was strictly forbidden. He gave me the same answer when I asked if I might have the newspapers.',\n",
       " 'It was a festival time for the sentinels, as I shared my meals and my good wine with them; and consequently these poor fellows were firmly attached to me. I was curious to know who was paying for my good cheer, but there was no chance of my finding out, for the waiter from the inn was never allowed to approach my cell. In this dungeon, where I was imprisoned for forty–two days, I wrote in pencil and without other reference than my memory, my refutation of Amelot de la Houssaye\\'s \"History of the Venetian Government. \" I was most heartily amused during my imprisonment, and in the following manner: While I was at Warsaw an Italian named Tadini came to Warsaw. He had an introduction to Tomatis who commended him to me. Tomatis used to give him a dinner now and again, but not being well off in those days I could only give him good words and a cup of coffee when he chanced to come about my breakfast–time.',\n",
       " 'Tadini talked to everybody about the operations he had performed, and condemned an oculist who had been at Warsaw for twenty years, saying that he did not understand how to extract a cataract, while the other oculist said that Tadini was a charlatan who did not know how the eye was made. Tadini begged me to speak in his favour to a lady who had had a cataract removed by the Warsaw oculist, only to return again a short time after the operation. The lady was blind of the one eye, but she could see with the other, and I told Tadini that I did not care to meddle with such a delicate matter. \"I have spoken to the lady,\" said Tadini, \"and I have mentioned your name as a person who will answer for me. \" \"You have done wrong; in such a matter I would not stand surety for the most learned of men, and I know nothing about your learning. \" \"I know you were introduced to me as such, but that\\'s all.',\n",
       " 'As a professional man, you should not need anyone\\'s commendation, you should be able to say, \\'Operibus credite\\'. \" Tadini was vexed with my incredulity, and shewed me a number of testimonials, which I might possibly have read, if the first which met my eye had not been from a lady who protested to all and singular that M. At this I laughed in his face and told him to leave me alone. A few days after I found myself dining with him at the house of the lady with the cataract. She had almost made up her mind to submit to the operation, but as the rascal had mentioned my name, she wanted me to be present at a dispute between Tadini and the other oculist who came in with the dessert. I disposed myself to listen to the arguments of the two rival professors with considerable pleasure. The Warsaw oculist was a German, but spoke French very well; however, he attacked Tadini in Latin.',\n",
       " 'The Italian checked him by saying that their discourse must be conducted in a language intelligible to the lady, and I agreed with him. It was plain that Tadini did not know a word of Latin. The German oculist began by admitting that after the operation for cataract there was no chance of the disease returning, but that there was a considerable risk of the crystalline humour evaporating, and the patient being left in a state of total blindness. Tadini, instead of denying this statement (which was inaccurate), had the folly to take a little box out of his pocket. \"A substance which I can place in the cornea to supply the loss of the crystalline matter. \" The German went off into a roar of laughter so long and loud that the lady could not help laughing. I should have liked to join them, but I was ashamed to be thought the patron of this ignorant fellow, so I preserved a gloomy silence.',\n",
       " 'Tadini no doubt interpreted my silence as a mark of disapproval of the German\\'s laughter, and thought to better matters by asking me to give my opinion. \" \"There\\'s a great difference between a tooth and the crystalline humour; and though you may have succeeded in putting an artificial tooth into a gum, this treatment will not do with the eye. \" At this the ignorant rascal got up and left the room, and it was decidedly the best thing he could do. We laughed over this new treatment, and the lady promised to have nothing more to do with him. The professor was not content to despise his opponent in silence. He had him cited before the Faculty of Medicine to be examined on his knowledge of the eye, and procured the insertion of a satiric article in the news on the new operation for replacing the crystalline humour, alluding to the wonderful artist then in Warsaw who could perform this operation as easily as a dentist could put in a false tooth.',\n",
       " 'This made Tadini furious, and he set upon the old professor in the street and forced him to the refuge in a house. After this he no doubt left the town on foot, for he was seen no more. Now the reader is in a position to understand my surprise and amusement, when, one day as I peered through the grating in my dungeon, I saw the oculist Tadini standing over me with gun in hand. But he at all events evinced no amusement whatever, while I roared and roared again with laughter for the two hours his duty lasted. I gave him a good meal and a sufficiency of my excellent wine, and at the end a crown, promising that he should have the same treatment every time he returned to the post. But I only saw him four times, as the guard at my cell was a position eagerly coveted and intrigued for by the other soldiers. He amused me by the story of his misadventures since he had left Warsaw.',\n",
       " 'He had travelled far and wide without making a fortune, and at last arrived in Barcelona, where he failed to meet with any courtesy or consideration. He had no introduction, no diploma; he had refused to submit to an examination in the Latin tongue, because (as he said) there was no connection between the learned languages and the diseases of the eye; and the result was that, instead of the common fate of being ordered to leave the country, he was made into a soldier. He told me in confidence that he intended to desert, but he said he should take care to avoid the galleys. \"What have you done with your crystals?\" \"I have renounced them since I left Warsaw, though I am sure they would succeed. On December 28th, six weeks after my arrest, the officer of the guard came to my cell and told me to dress and follow him. \"Where are we going?\" \"I am about to deliver you to an officer of the viceroy, who is waiting.',\n",
       " '\" I dressed hastily, and after placing all my belongings in a portmanteau I followed him. We went to the guardroom, and there I was placed under the charge of the officer who had arrested me, who took me to the palace. There a Government official shewed me my trunk, telling me that I should find all my papers intact; and he then returned me my three passports, with the remark that they were genuine documents. \" \"I suppose so, but we had reasons for doubting their authenticity. \" \"They must have been strange reasons, for, as you now confess, these reasons were devoid of reason. \" \"You must be aware that I cannot reply to such an objection. \" \"Your character is perfectly clear; all the same I must request you to leave Barcelona in three days, and Catalonia in a week. \" \"Of course I will obey; but it strikes me that the Catalonian method of repairing injustice is somewhat peculiar. \" \"If you think you have ground for complaint you are at liberty to go to Madrid and complain to the Court.',\n",
       " '\" \"I have certainly grounds enough for complaint, sir, but I shall go to France, and not to Madrid; I have had enough of Spanish justice. Will you please give me the order to leave in writing?\" \"That\\'s unnecessary; you may take it for granted. My name is Emmanuel Badillo; I am a secretary of state. That gentleman will escort you back to the room where you were arrested. To–morrow I will send you your passport, signed by the viceroy and myself. \" Accompanied by the officer and a servant bearing my portmanteau, I proceeded to my old inn. On my way I saw a theatrical poster, and decided to go to the opera. The good landlord was delighted to see me again, and hastened to light me a fire, for a bitterly cold north wind was blowing. He assured me that no one but himself had been in my room, and in the officer\\'s presence he gave me back my sword, my great coat, and, to my astonishment, the hat I had dropped in my flight from the assassins.',\n",
       " 'The officer asked me if I had any complaints to make, and I replied that I had none. \"I should like to hear you say that I had done nothing but my duty, and that personally I have not done you any injury. \"Farewell, sir,\" said he, \"I hope you will have a pleasant journey. \" I told my landlord that I would dine at noon, and that I trusted to him to celebrate my liberation in a fitting manner, and then I went to the post office to see if there were any letters for me. I found five or six letters, with the seals intact, much to my astonishment. What is one to make of a Government which deprives a man of his liberty on some trifling pretext, and, though seizing all his papers, respects the privacy of his letters? But Spain, as I have remarked, is peculiar in every way. These letters were from Paris, Venice, Warsaw, and Madrid, and I have never had any reason to believe that any other letters had come for me during my imprisonment.',\n",
       " 'I went back to my inn, and asked my landlord to bring the bill. Here is your bill for the period preceding your imprisonment, and, as you see, it has been settled. I also received orders from the same source to provide for you during your imprisonment, and as long as you stayed at Barcelona. \" \"Did you know how long I should remain in prison?\" \"No, I was paid by the week. \" \"What has become of the valet de place?\" \"I paid him, and sent him away immediately after your arrest. \" \"I should like to have him with me as far as Perpignan. \" \"You are right, and I think the best thing you can do is to leave Spain altogether, for you will find no justice in it. \" \"What do they say about my assassination?\" \"Why, they say you fired the shot that people heard yourself, and that you made your own sword bloody, for no one was found there, either dead or wounded. Where did my hat come from?\" \"It was brought to me three days after.',\n",
       " '\" \"What a confusion! But was it known that I was imprisoned in the tower?\" \"Everybody knew it, and two good reasons were given, the one in public, and the other in private. \" \"What are these reasons?\" \"The public reason was that you had forged your passports; the private one, which was only whispered at the ear, was that you spent all your nights with Nina. \" \"You might have sworn that I never slept out of your inn. \" \"I told everyone as much, but no matter; you did go to her house, and for a certain nobleman that\\'s a crime. I am glad you did not fly as I advised you, for as it is your character is cleared before everybody. \" \"I should like to go to the opera this evening; take me a box. \" \"It shall be done; but do not have anything more to do with Nina, I entreat you. \" \"No, my good friend, I have made up my mind to see her no more. \" Just as I was sitting down to dinner, a banker\\'s clerk brought me a letter which pleased me very much.',\n",
       " 'It contained the bills of exchange I had drawn in Genoa, in favour of M. He now sent them back, with these words: \"Passano has been vainly endeavouring to persuade me to send these bills to Barcelona, so that they may be protested, and you arrested. I now send them to you to convince you that I am not one of those who delight in trampling down the victims of bad fortune. \" For the fourth time a Genoese had behaved most generously to me. I was almost persuaded that I ought to forgive the infamous Passano for the sake of his four excellent fellow–countrymen. I concluded that the best thing I could do would be to rid the Genoese name of the opprobrium which this rascal was always bringing on it, but I could never find an opportunity. Some years after I heard that the wretch died in miserable poverty in Genoa. I was curious at the time to know what had become of him, as it was important for me to be on my guard.',\n",
       " \"I confided my curiosity to my landlord, and he instructed one of the servants to make enquiries. I only heard the following circumstance: Ascanio Pogomas, or Passano, had been released at the end of November, and had then been embarked on a felucca bound for Toulon. The same day I wrote a long and grateful letter to M. I had indeed reason to be grateful, for if he had listened to my enemy he might have reduced me to a state of dreadful misery. My landlord had taken the box at the opera in my name, and two hours afterwards, to everyone's great astonishment, the posters announcing the plays of the evening were covered by bills informing the public that two of the performers had been taken ill, that the play would not be given, and the theatre closed till the second day of the new year. This order undoubtedly came from the viceroy, and everybody knew the reason.\",\n",
       " \"I was sorry to have deprived the people of Barcelona of the only amusement they had in the evening, and resolved to stay indoors, thinking that would be the most dignified course I could adopt. Petrarch says,— 'Amor che fa gentile un cor villano'. If he had known the lover of Nina he would have changed the line into 'Amor che fa villan un cor gentile'. In four months I shall be able to throw some more light on this strange business. I should have left Barcelona the same day, but a slight tinge of superstition made me desire to leave on the last day of the unhappy year I had spent in Spain. I therefore spent my three days of grace in writing letters to all my friends. Don Miguel de Cevallos, Don Diego de la Secada, and the Comte de la Peralada came to see me, but separately. Don Diego de la Secada was the uncle of the Countess A― B― whom I had met at Milan. These gentlemen told me a tale as strange as any of the circumstances which had happened to me at Barcelona.\",\n",
       " \"On the 26th of December the Abbe Marquisio, the envoy of the Duke of Modena, asked the viceroy, before a considerable number of people, if he could pay me a visit, to give me a letter which he could place in no hands but mine. If not he said he should be obliged to take the letter to Madrid, for which town he was obliged to set out the next day. The count made no answer, to everyone's astonishment, and the abbe left for Madrid the next day, the eve of my being set at liberty. I wrote to the abbe, who was unknown to me, but I never succeeded in finding out the truth about this letter. There could be no doubt that I had been arrested by the despotic viceroy, who had been persuaded by Nina that I was her favoured lover. The question of my passports must have been a mere pretext, for eight or ten days would have sufficed to send them to Madrid and have them back again if their authenticity had been doubted.\",\n",
       " 'Possibly Passano might have told the viceroy that any passports of mine were bound to be false, as I should have had to obtain the signature of my own ambassador. This, he might have said, was out of the question as I was in disgrace with the Venetian Government. As a matter of fact, he was mistaken if he really said so, but the mistake would have been an excusable one. When I made up my mind at the end of August to leave Madrid, I asked the Count of Aranda for a passport. He replied that I must first obtain one from my ambassador, who, he added, could not refuse to do me this service. Fortified with this opinion I called at the embassy. Querini was at San Ildefonso at the time, and I told the porter that I wanted to speak to the secretary of embassy. The servant sent in my name, and the fop gave himself airs, and pretended that he could not receive me.',\n",
       " 'In my indignation I wrote to him saying that I had not called to pay my court to the secretary, but to demand a passport which was my right. I gave my name and my degree (doctor of law), and begged him to leave the passport with the porter, as I should call for it on the following day. I presented myself accordingly, and the porter told me that the ambassador had left verbal orders that I was not to have a passport. I wrote immediately to the Marquis Grimaldi and to the Duke of Lossada, begging them to request the ambassador to send me a passport in the usual form, or else I should publish the shameful reasons for which his uncle Mocenigo had disgraced me. I do not know whether these gentlemen shewed my letters to Querini, but I do know that the secretary Oliviera sent me my passport. Thereupon the Count Aranda furnished me with a passport signed by the king.',\n",
       " 'On the last day of the year I left Barcelona with a servant who sat behind my chaise, and I agreed with my driver to take me to Perpignan by January 3rd, 1769. The driver was a Piedmontese and a worthy man: The next day he came into the room of the wayside inn where I was dining, and in the presence of my man asked me whether I had any suspicion that I was being followed. \"Well, I may be,\" I said, \"but what makes you ask that question?\" \"As you were leaving Barcelona yesterday, I noticed three ill–looking fellows watching us, armed to the teeth. They dined here to–day, and they went on three quarters of an hour ago. They don\\'t speak to anyone, and I don\\'t like the looks of them. \" \"What shall we do to avoid assassination, or the dread of it?\" \"We must start late, and stop at an inn I know of, a league this side of the ordinary stage where they will be awaiting us. If they turn back, and sleep at the same inn as ourselves, we shall be certain.',\n",
       " '\" I thought the idea a sensible one, and we started, I going on foot nearly the whole way; and at five o\\'clock we halted at a wretched inn, but we saw no signs of the sinister trio. At eight o\\'clock I was at supper, when my man came in and told me that the three fellows had come back, and were drinking with our driver in the stable. At present, it was true, I had nothing to fear; but it would be getting dark when we arrived at the frontier, and then my peril would come. I told my servant to shew no sign, but to ask the driver to come and speak with me when the assassins were asleep. He came at ten o\\'clock, and told me plainly that we should be all murdered as we approached the French frontier. \"Then you have been drinking with them?\" \"Yes, and after we had dispatched a bottle at my expense, one of them asked me why I had not gone on to the end of the stage, where you would be better lodged.',\n",
       " 'I might have asked in my turn, why they had not stayed at the stage themselves, and where they were going, but I took care to do nothing of the kind. All I asked was whether the road to Perpignan was a good one, and they told me it was excellent all the way. \" \"What are they doing now?\" \"They are sleeping by my mules, covered with their cloaks. \" \"What shall we do?\" \"We will start at day–break after them, of course, and we shall dine at the usual stage; but after dinner, trust me, we will take a different road, and at midnight we shall be in France safe and sound. \" If I could have procured a good armed escort I would not have taken his advice, but in the situation I was in I had no choice. We found the three scoundrels in the place where the driver had told me we should see them. I gave them a searching glance, and thought they looked like true Sicarii, ready to kill anyone for a little money.',\n",
       " \"They started in a quarter of an hour, and half an hour later we set out, with a peasant to guide us, and so struck into a cross road. The mules went at a sharp pace, and in seven hours we had done eleven leagues. At ten o'clock we stopped at an inn in a French village, and we had no more to fear. I gave our guide a doubloon, with which he was well pleased, and I enjoyed once more a peaceful night in a French bed, for nowhere will you find such soft beds or such delicious wines as in the good land of France. The next day I arrived at the posting–inn at Perpignan in time for dinner. I endeavoured in vain to think who could have paid my assassins, but the reader will see the explanation when we get twenty days farther. At Perpignan I dismissed my driver and my servant, rewarding them according to my ability. I wrote to my brother at Paris, telling him I had had a fortunate escape from the dagger of the assassin.\",\n",
       " 'I begged him to direct his answer to Aix, where I intended to spend a fortnight, in the hope of seeing the Marquis d\\'Argens. I left Perpignan the day after my arrival, and slept at Narbonne, and the day after at Beziers. The distance from Narbonne to Beziers is only five leagues, and I had not intended to stop; but the good cheer which the kindest of landladies gave me at dinner made me stop with her to supper. Beziers is a town which looks pleasant even at the worst time of the year. A philosopher who wished to renounce all the vanities of the world, and an Epicurean who would enjoy good cheer cheaply, could find no better retreat than Beziers. Everybody at Beziers is intelligent, all the women are pretty, and the cooks are all artists; the wines are exquisite—what more could one desire! May its riches never prove its ruin! When I reached Montpellier, I got down at the \"White Horse,\" with the intention of spending a week there.',\n",
       " \"In the evening I supped at the table d'hote, where I found a numerous company, and I saw to my amusement that for every guest there was a separate dish brought to table. 'Tis a veritable land of Cocagne! The next day I breakfasted at the cafe (an institution peculiar to France, the only country where the science of living is really understood), and addressed the first gentleman I met, telling him that I was a stranger and that I would like to know some of the professors. He immediately offered to take me to one of the professors who enjoyed a great reputation. Herein may be seen another of the good qualities of the French, who rank above other nations by so many titles. To a Frenchman a foreigner is a sacred being; he receives the best of hospitality, not merely in form, but in deed; and his welcome is given with that easy grace which so soon sets a stranger at his ease.\",\n",
       " 'My new friend introduced me to the professor, who received me with all the polished courtesy of the French man of letters. He that loves letters should love all other lovers of letters, and in France that is the case, even more so than Italy. In Germany the literary man has an air of mysterious reserve. He thinks he is proclaiming to all the world that he at all events is a man of no pretension, whereas his pride peeps through every moment. Naturally the stranger is not encouraged by such a manner as this. At the time of my visit there was an excellent company of actors at Montpellier, whom I went to see the same evening. My bosom swelled at finding myself in the blessed air of France after all the annoyances I had gone through in Spain. I seemed to have become young again; but I was altered, for several beautiful and clever actresses appeared on the stage without arousing any desires within me; and I would have it so.',\n",
       " \"I had a lively desire to find Madame Castelbajac, not with any wish to renew my old relations with her. I wished to congratulate her on her improved position, but I was afraid of compromising her by asking for her in the town. I knew that her husband was an apothecary, so I resolved to make the acquaintance of all the apothecaries in the place. I pretended to be in want of some very rare drugs, and entered into conversation about the differences between the trade in France and in foreign countries. If I spoke to the master I hoped he would talk to his wife about the stranger who had visited the countries where she had been, and that that would make her curious to know me. If, on the other hand, I spoke to the man, I knew he would soon tell me all he knew about his master's family. My old friend wrote me a note, telling me that she had seen me speaking to her husband in his shop.\",\n",
       " 'She begged me to come again at a certain time, and to tell her husband that I had known her under the name of Mdlle. Blasin in England, Spa, Leipzig, and Vienna, as a seller of lace. She ended her note with these words: \"I have no doubt that my husband will finally introduce you to me as his wife. \" I followed her advice, and the good man asked me if I had ever known a young lace seller of the name of Mdlle. \"Yes, I remember her well enough—a delightful and most respectable young woman; but I did not know she came from Montpellier. She was very pretty and very sensible, and I expect she did a good business. I have seen her in several European cities, and the last time at Vienna, where I was able to be of some slight service to her. Her admirable behaviour won her the esteem of all the ladies with whom she came in contact.',\n",
       " '\" \"Do you think you would recognize her if you saw her again?\" \"By Jove! I should think so! But is she at Montpellier? If so, tell her that the Chevalier de Seingalt is here. \" \"Sir, you shall speak to her yourself, if you will do me the honour to follow me. The worthy apothecary went through the shop, climbed a stair, and, opening a door on the first floor, said to me,— \"There she is. \" \"What, mademoiselle! You here? I am delighted to see you. \" \"This is not a young lady, sir, \\'tis my dear wife; but I hope that will not hinder you from embracing her. \" \"I have never had such an honour; but I will avail myself of your permission with pleasure. I congratulate both of you, and wish you all health and happiness. Tell me, did you have a pleasant journey from Vienna to Lyons?\" Madame Blasin (for so I must continue to designate her) answered my question according to her fancy, and found me as good an actor as she was an actress.',\n",
       " 'We were very glad to see each other again, but the apothecary was delighted at the great respect with which I treated his wife. For a whole hour we carried on a conversation of a perfectly imaginary character, and with all the simplicity of perfect truth. She asked me if I thought of spending the carnival at Montpellier, and seemed quite mortified when I said that I thought of going on the next day. Her husband hastened to say that that was quite out of the question. \"Oh, I hope you won\\'t go,\" she added, \"you must do my husband the honour of dining with us. \" After the husband had pressed me for some time I gave in, and accepted their invitation to dinner for the day after next. I was much pleased with the husband\\'s mother, who was advanced in years but extremely intelligent. She had evidently made a point of forgetting everything unpleasant in the past history of her son\\'s wife.',\n",
       " 'Madame Blasin told me in private that she was perfectly happy, and I had every reason to believe that she was speaking the truth. She had made a rule to be most precise in fulfilling her wifely duties, and rarely went out unless accompanied by her husband or her mother–in–law. I spent these four days in the enjoyment of pure and innocent friendship without there being the slightest desire on either side to renew our guilty pleasures. On the third day after I had dined with her and her husband, she told me, while we were alone for a moment, that if I wanted fifty louis she knew where to get them for me. I told her to keep them for another time, if I was so happy as to see her again, and so unhappy as to be in want. I left Montpellier feeling certain that my visit had increased the esteem in which her husband and her mother–in–law held her, and I congratulated myself on my ability to be happy without committing any sins.',\n",
       " 'The day after I had bade them farewell, I slept at Nimes, where I spent three days in the company of a naturalist: M. de Seguier, the friend of the Marquis Maffei of Verona. In his cabinet of natural history I saw and admired the immensity and infinity of the Creator\\'s handiwork. Nimes is a town well worthy of the stranger\\'s observation; it provides food for the mind, and the fair sex, which is really fair there, should give the heart the food it likes best. I was asked to a ball, where, as a foreigner, I took first place—a privilege peculiar to France, for in England, and still more in Spain, a foreigner means an enemy. On leaving Nimes I resolved to spend the carnival at Aix, where the nobility is of the most distinguished character. I believe I lodged at the \"Three Dolphins,\" where I found a Spanish cardinal on his way to Rome to elect a successor to Pope Rezzonico.',\n",
       " 'Chapter III My Stay at Aix; I Fall Ill--i Am Cared for by an Unknown Lady--the Marquis D\\'argens--cagliostro My room was only separated from his Castilian eminence\\'s by a light partition, and I could hear him quite plainly reprimanding his chief servant for being too economical. \"My lord, I do my best, but it is really impossible to spend more, unless I compel the inn–keepers to take double the amount of their bills; and your eminence will admit that nothing in the way of rich and expensive dishes has been spared. \" \"That may be, but you ought to use your wits a little; you might for example order meals when we shall not require any. Take care that there are always three tables—one for us, one for my officers, and the third for the servants. Why I see that you only give the postillions a franc over the legal charge, I really blush for you; you must give them a crown extra at least.',\n",
       " 'When they give you change for a louis, leave it on the table; to put back one\\'s change in one\\'s pocket is an action only worthy of a beggar. They will be saying at Versailles and Madrid, and maybe at Rome itself, that the Cardinal de la Cerda is a miser. I am no such thing, and I do not want to be thought one. You must really cease to dishonour me, or leave my service. \" A year before this speech would have astonished me beyond measure, but now I was not surprised, for I had acquired some knowledge of Spanish manners. I might admire the Senor de la Cerda\\'s prodigality, but I could not help deploring such ostentation on the part of a Prince of the Church about to participate in such a solemn function. What I had heard him say made me curious to see him, and I kept on the watch for the moment of his departure. What a man! He was not only ill made, short and sun–burnt; but his face was so ugly and so low that I concluded that AEsop himself must have been a little Love beside his eminence.',\n",
       " \"I understood now why he was so profuse in his generosity and decorations, for otherwise he might well have been taken for a stableboy. If the conclave took the eccentric whim of making him pope, Christ would never have an uglier vicar. I enquired about the Marquis d'Argens soon after the departure of his eminence, and was told that he was in the country with his brother, the Marquis d'Eguille, President of the Parliament, so I went there. This marquis, famous for his friendship for Frederick II. rather than for his writings (which are no longer read), was an old man when I saw him. He was a worthy man, fond of pleasure, a thorough–paced Epicurean, and had married an actress named Cochois, who had proved worthy of the honour he had laid on her. He was deeply learned and had a thorough knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew literature. He received me very well, and recalled what his friend the marshal had written about me.\",\n",
       " 'He introduced me to his wife and to his brother, a distinguished jurist, a man of letters, and a strictly moral man by temperament as much as religion. Though a highly intellectual man, he was deeply and sincerely religious. He was very fond of his brother, and grieved for his irreligion, but hoped that grace would eventually bring him back to the fold of the Church. His brother encouraged him in his hopes, while laughing at them in private, but as they were both sensible men they never discussed religion together. I was introduced to a numerous company of both sexes, chiefly consisting of relations. All were amiable and highly polished, like all the Provencal nobility. Plays were performed on the miniature stage, good cheer prevailed, and at intervals we walked in the garden, in spite of the weather. In Province, however, the winter is only severe when the wind blows from the north, which unfortunately often happens.',\n",
       " \"Among the company were a Berlin lady (widow of the marquis's nephew) and her brother. This young gentleman, who was gay and free from care, enjoyed all the pleasures of the house without paying any attention to the religious services which were held every day. If he thought on the matter at all, he was a heretic; and when the Jesuit chaplain was saying mass he amused himself by playing on the flute; he laughed at everything. He was unlike his sister, who had not only become a Catholic, but was a very devout one. Her brother told me that her husband, who had died of consumption, and whose mind was perfectly clear to the last, as is usually the case in phthisis, had told her that he could not entertain any hopes of seeing her in the other world unless she became a Catholic. These words were engraved on her heart; she had adored her husband, and she resolved to leave Berlin to live with his relations.\",\n",
       " \"No one ventured to oppose this design, her brother accompanying her, and she was welcomed joyfully by all her husband's kinsfolk. Her brother, finding me less strict than the others, soon constituted himself my friend. He came over to Aix every day, and took me to the houses of all the best people. We were at least thirty at table every day, the dishes were delicate without undue profusion, the conversation gay and animated without any improprieties. I noticed that whenever the Marquis d'Argens chanced to let slip any equivocal expressions, all the ladies made wry faces, and the chaplain hastened to turn the conversation. This chaplain had nothing jesuitical in his appearance; he dressed in the costume of an ordinary priest, and I should never had known him if the Marquis d'Argens had not warned me. However, I did not allow his presence to act as a wet blanket.\",\n",
       " 'I told, in the most decent manner possible, the story of the picture of the Virgin suckling her Divine Child, and how the Spaniards deserted the chapel after a stupid priest had covered the beautiful breast with a kerchief. I do not know how it was, but all the ladies began to laugh. The disciple of Loyola was so displeased at their mirth, that he took upon himself to tell me that it was unbecoming to tell such equivocal stories in public. I thanked him by an inclination of the head, and the Marquis d\\'Argens, by way of turning the conversation, asked me what was the Italian for a splendid dish of stewed veal, which Madame d\\'Argens was helping. \"Una crostata,\" I replied, \"but I really do not know the Italian for the \\'beatilles\\' with which it is stuffed. \" These \\'beatilles\\' were balls of rice, veal, champignons, artichoke, foie gras, etc. The Jesuit declared that in calling them \\'beatilles\\' I was making a mock of the glories of hereafter.',\n",
       " 'I could not help roaring with laughter at this, and the Marquis d\\'Eguille took my part, and said that \\'beatilles\\' was the proper French for these balls. After this daring difference of opinion with his director, the worthy man thought it would be best to talk of something else. Unhappily, however, he fell out of the frying–pan into the fire by asking me my opinion as to the election of the next pope. \"I believe it will be Ganganelli,\" I replied, \"as he is the only monk in the conclave. \" \"Why should it be necessary to choose a monk?\" \"Because none but a monk would dare to commit the excess which the Spaniards will demand of the new pope. \" \"I hope not, for the Jesuits were my masters, and I love them accordingly. But all the same Ganganelli will be elected, for an amusing and yet a weighty reason. \" \"He is the only cardinal who does not wear a wig; and you must consider that since the foundation of the Holy See the Pope has never been bewigged.',\n",
       " '\" This reason created a great deal of amusement; but the conversation was brought back to the suppression of the Jesuits, and when I told the company that I had heard from the Abbe Pinzi I saw the Jesuit turn pale. \"It seems that you have never been at a Jesuit seminary,\" I replied, \"for the dogma of the order is that the Pope can do everything, \\'et aliquid pluris\\'. \" This answer made everybody suppose me to be unaware that I was speaking to a Jesuit, and as he gave me no answer the topic was abandoned. After dinner I was asked to stay and see \\'Polieucte\\' played; but I excused myself, and returned to Aix with the young Berliner, who told me the story of his sister, and made me acquainted with the character of the society to which the Marquis d\\'Eguille was chiefly addicted. I felt that I could never adapt myself to their prejudices, and if it had not been for my young friend, who introduced me to some charming people, I should have gone on to Marseilles.',\n",
       " 'What with assemblies, balls, suppers, and the society of the handsome Provenqal ladies, I managed to spend the whole of the carnival and a part of Lent at Aix. I had made a present of a copy of the \"Iliad\" to the learned Marquis d\\'Argens; to his daughter, who was also a good scholar, I gave a Latin tragedy. The \"Iliad\" had Porphyry\\'s comment; it was a copy of a rare edition, and was richly bound. As the marquis came to Aix to thank me, I had to pay another visit to the country house. I had no cloak, and a cold north wind was blowing; I was perishing with cold, but instead of going to bed at once I accompanied the Berliner to the house of a woman who had a daughter of the utmost beauty. Though the girl was only fourteen, she had all the indications of the marriageable age, and yet none of the Provencal amateurs had succeeded in making her see daylight. My friend had already made several unsuccessful efforts.',\n",
       " \"I laughed at him, as I knew it was all a cheat, and I followed him to the house with the idea of making the young imposter dismount from her high horse, as I had done in similar cases in England and Metz. We set to work; and, far from resisting, the girl said she would be only too glad to get rid of the troublesome burden. I saw that the difficulty only proceeded from the way she held herself, and I ought to have whipped her, as I had done in Venice twenty–five years ago, but I was foolish enough to try to take the citadel by storm. I wearied myself to no purpose for a couple of hours, and then went to my inn, leaving the young Prussian to do his best. I went to bed with a pain in my side, and after six hours' sleep awoke feeling thoroughly ill. My landlord called in an old doctor, who refused to let me blood. A severe cough came on, and the next day I began to spit blood. In six or seven days the malady became so serious that I was confessed and received the last sacraments.\",\n",
       " 'On the tenth day, the disease having abated for three days, my clever old doctor answered for my life, but I continued to spit blood till the eighteenth day. My convalescence lasted for three weeks, and I found it more trying than the actual illness, for a man in pain has no time to grow weary. Throughout the whole case I was tended day and night by a strange woman, of whom I knew nothing. She nursed me with the tenderest care, and I awaited my recovery to give her my sincere thanks. She was not an old woman, neither was she attractive looking. After Eastertide, feeling I was well enough to venture out, I thanked her to the best of my ability, and asked who had sent her to me. She told me it was the doctor, and so bade me farewell. A few days later I was thanking my old doctor for having procured me such a capital nurse, but he stared at me and said he knew nothing about the woman.',\n",
       " 'I was puzzled, and asked my landlord if she could throw any light on the strange nurse\\'s identity; but she knew nothing, and her ignorance seemed universal. I could not discover whence or how she came to attend me. After my convalescence I took care to get all the letters which had been awaiting me, and amongst them was a letter from my brother in Paris, in answer to the epistle I wrote him from Perpignan. He acknowledged my letter, and told me how delighted he had been to receive it, after hearing the dreadful news that I had been assassinated on the borders of Catalonia at the beginning of January. \"The person who gave me the news,\" my brother added, \"was one of your best friends, Count Manucci, an attache at the Venetian embassy. He said there could be no doubt as to the truth of the report. This friend of mine had pushed his vengeance so far as to pay assassins to deprive me of my life. He must have been pretty well qualified to prophesy, as he was so certain of my death.',\n",
       " \"He might have known that in thus proclaiming in advance the manner of my death, he was also proclaiming himself as my murderer. I met him at Rome, two years later, and when I would have made him confess his guilt, he denied everything, saying he had received the news from Barcelona; however, we will speak of this in its proper place. I dined and supped every day at the table d'hote, and one day I heard the company talking of a male and female pilgrim who had recently arrived. They were said to be high–born folks, as they had distributed large alms on their entry into the town. It was said that the female pilgrim, who had gone to bed on her arrival, was charming. They were staying at the same inn as I was, and we all got very curious about them. As an Italian, I put myself at the head of the band who proceeded to call on the pilgrims, who, in my opinion, must either be fanatics or rogues. We found the lady sitting in an arm–chair, looking very tired.\",\n",
       " 'She was young, beautiful, and melancholy–looking, and in her hands she held a brass crucifix some six inches long. She laid it down when we came in, and got up and received us most graciously. Her companion, who was arranging cockle–shells on his black mantle, did not stir; he seemed to say, by glancing at his wife, that we must confine our attentions to her. He seemed a man of twenty–four or twenty–five years of age. He was short and badly hung, and his face bore all the indications of daring, impudence, sarcasm, and imposture. His wife, on the other hand, was all meekness and simplicity, and had that modesty which adds so much to the charm of feminine beauty. They only spoke just enough French to make themselves understood on their journey, and when they heard me addressing them in Italian they seemed much relieved. The lady told me she was a Roman, but I could have guessed as much from her accent.',\n",
       " 'Their passport, dated Rome, called him Balsamo, while she bore the names of Serafina Feliciani, which she still retains. Ten years later we shall hear more of this couple under the name of Cagliostro. \"We are going back to Rome,\" said she, \"well pleased with our devotions to St. We have walked the whole way on foot, living on alms, so as to more surely win the mercy of the God whom I have offended so grievously. We have had silver, and even gold money given us, and in every town we came to we gave what remained to the poor, so as not to offend God by lack of faith. \"My husband is strong, and has not suffered much, but I have found so much walking very fatiguing. We have slept on straw or bad beds, always with our clothes on, to avoid contracting diseases it would be hard to rid one\\'s self of. \" It seemed to me that this last circumstance was added to make us wish to find out whether the rest of her body could compare with her hands and arms in whiteness.',\n",
       " '\"Do you think of making any stay?\" \"My weariness will oblige us to stay here for three days; then we shall go to Rome by the way of Turin, where we shall pay our devotion to the Holy Sudary. \" \"You know, of course, that there are several of them in Europe. \" \"So we have heard, but we are assured that the Sudary of Turin is the true one. Veronica wiped the face of Our Lord, who left the imprint of His divine face upon it. \" We left them, well pleased with the appearance and manners of the lady pilgrim, but placing very little trust in her devotion. I was still weak from my illness, and she inspired me with no desires, but the rest would have gladly supped with her if they had thought there was anything to follow. Next day her husband asked me if I would come up and breakfast with them, or if they should come down and breakfast with me. It would have been impolite to have replied neither, so I said that I should be delighted to see them in my room.',\n",
       " 'At breakfast I asked the pilgrim what he did, and he replied that he was an artist. He could not design a picture, but he could copy it, and he assured me that he could copy an engraving so exactly that none could tell the copy from the original. If you are not a rich man, you are, at least, certain of earning a living with this talent. I have pursued this craft at Rome and at Naples, and found I had to work all day to make half a tester, and that\\'s not enough to live on. \" He then shewed me some fans he had done, and I thought them most beautiful. They were done in pen and ink, and the finest copper–plate could not have surpassed them. Next he showed me a copy from a Rembrandt, which if anything, was finer than the original. In spite of all he swore that the work he got barely supported him, but I did not believe what he said. He was a weak genius who preferred a vagabond life to methodical labour.',\n",
       " \"I offered a Louis for one of his fans, but he refused to take it, begging me to accept the fan as a gift, and to make a collection for him at the table d'hote, as he wanted to start the day after next. I accepted the present and promised to do as he desired, and succeeded in making up a purse of two hundred francs for them. She was asked to write her name on a lottery ticket, but refused, saying that no honest girls were taught to write at Rome. Everybody laughed at this excuse except myself, and I pitied her, as I could see that she was of very low origin. Next day she came and asked me to give her a letter of introduction for Avignon. Audifret the banker, and the other to the landlady of the inn. In the evening she returned me the letter to the banker, saying that it was not necessary for their purposes. At the same time she asked me to examine the letter closely, to see if it was really the same document I had given her. She laughed, and told me I was mistaken as it was only a copy.\",\n",
       " '\"Impossible!\" She called her husband, who came with the letter in his hand. I could doubt no longer, and said to him,— \"You are a man of talents, for it is much harder to imitate a handwriting than an engraving. You ought to make this talent serve you in good stead; but be careful, or it may cost you your life. In ten years I saw them again under the name of Count and Countess Pellegrini.

       " \"Chapter IV My Departure--letter From Henriette--marsellies--history of Nina--nice-- Turin--lugano--madame De**** As soon as I had regained my usual strength, I went to take leave of the Marquis d'Argens and his brother. I dined with them, pretending not to observe the presence of the Jesuit, and I then spent three delightful hours in conversation with the learned and amiable Marquis d'Argens. He told me a number of interesting anecdotes about the private life of Frederick II. No doubt the reader would like to have them, but I lack the energy to set them down. Perhaps some other day when the mists about Dux have dispersed, and some rays of the sun shine in upon me, I shall commit all these anecdotes to paper, but now I have not the courage to do so. Frederick had his good and his bad qualities, like all great men, but when every deduction on the score of his failings has been made, he still remains the noblest figure in the eighteenth century.\",\n",
       " \"The King of Sweden, who has been assassinated, loved to excite hatred that he might have the glory of defying it to do its worst. He was a despot at heart, and he came to a despot's end. He might have foreseen a violent death, for throughout his life he was always provoking men to the point of despair. There can be no comparison between him and Frederick. The Marquis d'Argens made me a present of all his works, and on my asking him if I could congratulate myself on possessing the whole number, he said yes, with the exception of a fragment of autobiography which he had written in his youth, and which he had afterwards suppressed. Never give way to this temptation, if it assails you. If you once begin on this plan you are not only compelled to record all your vices and follies, but to treat them in the severe tone of a philosophical historian. You must not, of course, omit the good you may have done; and so praise and blame is mingled on every page.\",\n",
       " 'All the evil you say of yourself will be held for gospel, your peccadilloes will be made into crimes, and your good deeds will not only be received with incredulity, but you will be taxed with pride and vanity for having recorded them. Besides, if you write your memoirs, you make an enemy in every chapter if you once begin to tell the truth. A man should neither talk of himself nor write of himself, unless it be to refute some calumny or libel. \" I was convinced, and promised never to be guilty of such a folly, but in spite of that I have been writing memoirs for the last seven years, and though I repent of having begun, I have sworn to go on to the end. However, I write in the hope that my Memoirs may never see the light of day; in the first place the censure would not allow them to be printed, and in the second I hope I shall be strong–minded enough, when my last illness comes, to have all my papers burnt before my eyes.',\n",
       " 'If that be not the case I count on the indulgence of my readers, who should remember that I have only written my story to prevent my going mad in the midst of all the petty insults and disagreeables which I have to bear day by day from the envious rascals who live with me in this castle of Count Waldstein, or Wallenstein, at Dux. I write ten or twelve hours a day, and so keep black melancholy at bay. My readers shall hear more of my sufferings later on, if I do not die before I write them down. The day after Corpus Christi I left Aix for Marseilles. But here I must set down a circumstance that I had forgotten; I mean the procession of Corpus Christi. Everyone knows that this festival is celebrated with great ceremony all over Christendom; but at Aix these ceremonies are of such a nature that every man of sense must be shocked at my recital.',\n",
       " \"It is well known that this procession in honour of the Being of beings, represented under the sacramental forms, is followed by all the religious confraternities, and this is duly done at Aix; but the scandalous part of the ceremony is the folly and the buffoonery which is allowed in a rite which should be designed to stir up the hearts of men to awe and reverence their Creator. Instead of that, the devil, death, and the seven deadly sins, are impersonated in the procession. They are clad in the most absurd costumes, and make hideous contortions, beating and abusing each other in their supposed vexation at having to join in the Creator's praises. The people hoot and hiss them, the lower classes sing songs in derision of them, and play them all manner of tricks, and the whole scene is one of incredible noise, uproar, and confusion, more worthy of some pagan bacchanalia than a procession of Christian people.\",\n",
       " 'All the country–folk from five or six leagues around Aix pour into the town on that day to do honour to God. It is the only occasion of the kind, and the clergy, either knavish or ignorant, encourage all this shameful riot. The lower orders take it all in good faith, and anyone who raised any objection would run some risk, for the bishop goes in front of the saturnalia, and consequently it is all holy. I expressed my disapproval of the whole affair, as likely to bring discredit on religion, to a councillor of parliament, M. Marc; but he told me gravely that it was an excellent thing, as it brought no less than a hundred thousand francs into the town on the single day. I knew her real name, and remembering the message she had sent me by Marcoline I hoped to meet her in some assembly, being ready to adapt my conduct to hers. I had often heard her name mentioned, but I never allowed myself to ask any question, not wishing our old friendship to be suspected.',\n",
       " 'Believing her to be at her country house, I had resolved on paying her a visit, and had only stayed on at Aix so as to recover my health before seeing her. In due course I left Aix with a letter in my pocket for her, resolving to send it in, and to remain in my carriage till she asked me to get down. A man came to the door, took my letter, and said madam should have it without fail. She will be coming here in three weeks to spend the summer as usual. \" \"Will you let me write a letter?\" \"If you will get down you will find all the necessary materials in madam\\'s room. \" I went into the house, and to my extreme surprise found myself face to face with my nurse. \" \"How did you come to nurse me?\" \"If you will step upstairs I will tell you. \" Her story was as follows: \"Madam sent for me in haste, and told me to go and attend to you as if it were herself. She told me to say that the doctor had sent me if you asked any questions.',\n",
       " '\" \"Perhaps he was speaking the truth, but most likely he had received orders from madam. That\\'s all I know, but I wonder you haven\\'t seen her at Aix. \" \"She cannot see any company, for I have been everywhere. \" \"She does not see any company at her own house, but she goes everywhere. I must have seen her, and yet I do not think I could have passed her by unrecognized. You have been with her ten years?\" \"Yes, sir, as I had the honour of informing you. \" \"Has she changed? Has she had any sickness? Has she aged?\" \"Not at all. She has become rather stout, but I assure you you would take her for a woman of thirty. \" The woman went out, leaving me in astonishment, at the extraordinary situation in which I was placed. \"Ought I to return to Aix immediately?\" I asked myself. She has a town house, but does not see company, but she might surely see me: She loves me still. She cared for me all through my illness, and she would not have done so if she had become indifferent to me.',\n",
       " 'She must know that I have left Aix, and will no doubt guess that I am here now. Shall I go to her or shall I write? I resolved to write, and I told her in my letter that I should await her reply at Marseilles. I gave the letter to my late nurse, with some money to insure its being dispatched at once, and drove on to Marseilles where I alighted at an obscure inn, not wishing to be recognized. I had scarcely got out of my carriage when I saw Madame Schizza, Nina\\'s sister. They had been at Marseilles three or four days and were going to Leghorn. Madame Schizza was alone at the moment, her husband having gone out; and as I was full of curiosity I begged her to come up to my room while my dinner was getting ready. \"What is your sister doing? Is she still at Barcelona?\" \"Yes; but she will not be there long, for the bishop will not have her in the town or the diocese, and the bishop is stronger than the viceroy.',\n",

She will have to leave in a month for certain, but she is not much put out, as the viceroy is sure to keep her wherever she goes, and she may eventually succeed in ruining him. In the meanwhile she is revelling in the bad repute she has gained for her lover. \" \"I know something of her peculiarities; but she cannot dislike a man who has made her rich. Do you imagine this monster capable of any feelings of gratitude? She is not a human being, and no one knows her as I do. She has made the count commit a hundred acts of injustice so that all Spain may talk of her, and know that she has made herself mistress of his body and soul, and all he has. The worse his actions are, the more certain she feels that people will talk of her, and that is all she wants.',\n",
       " 'Her obligations to me are beyond counting, for she owes me all, even to her existence, and instead of continuing my husband in her service she has sent him about his business. \" \"Then I wonder how she came to treat me so generously. \" \"If you knew all, you would not feel grateful to her. \" \"She only paid for your keep at the inn and in prison to make people believe you were her lover, and to shame the count. All Barcelona knows that you were assassinated at her door, and that you were fortunate enough to run the fellow through. \" \"But she cannot have been the instigator of, or even the accomplice in, the plot for my assassination. \" \"I dare say, but everything in Nina is against nature. What I tell you is the bare truth, for I was a witness of it all. Whenever the viceroy visited her she wearied him with praise of your gallantry, your wit, your noble actions, comparing you with the Spaniards, greatly to their disadvantage.',\n",
       " '\"The count got impatient and told her to talk of something else, but she would not; and at last he went away, cursing your name. Two days before you came to grief he left her, saying,— \"\\'Valga me Dios! I will give you a pleasure you do not expect. \\' \"I assure you that when we heard the pistol–shot after you had gone, she remarked, without evincing the slightest emotion, that the shot was the pleasure her rascally Spaniard had promised her. \"\\'All the worse for the count,\\' she replied, \\'for his turn will come also. \\' \"Then she began laughing like a madcap; she was thinking of the excitement your death would cause in Barcelona. \"At eight o\\'clock the following day, your man came and told her that you had been taken to the citadel; and I will say it to her credit, she seemed relieved to hear you were alive. \" \"My man—I did not know that he was in correspondence with her. \" \"No, I suppose not; but I assure you the worthy man was very much attached to you.',\n",
       " 'She did not shew it me, but it no doubt contained instructions to supply you with everything. \"The man told us that he had seen your sword all red with blood, and that your cloak had a bullet hole through it. She was delighted, but do not think it was because she loved you; she was glad you had escaped that you might take your revenge. However, she was troubled by the pretext on which the count had had you arrested. \"Ricla did not come to see her that day, but he came the next day at eight o\\'clock, and the infamous creature received him with a smiling face. She told him she had heard he had imprisoned you, and that she was obliged to him, as he had, of course, done so to protect you from any fresh attempts on your life. \"He answered, dryly, that your arrest had nothing to do with anything that might have happened the night before.',\n",
       " 'He added that you had only been seized pending the examination of your papers, and that if they were found to be in good form, you would be set at liberty in the course of a few days. \"Nina asked him who was the man that you had wounded. He replied that the police were enquiring into the matter, but that so far they had neither found a dead man nor a wounded man, nor any traces of blood. All that had been found was Casanova\\'s hat, and this had been returned to him. \"I left them alone together till midnight, so I cannot say what further converse they may have had on the subject, but three or four days later everybody knew that you were imprisoned in the tower. \"Nina asked the count the reason of this severity in the evening, and he replied that your passports were thought to be forgeries, because you were in disgrace with the State Inquisitors, and therefore would not be in a position to get a passport from the Venetian ambassador.',\n",
       " 'On this supposition he said you had been placed in the tower, and if it proved to be a true one, you would be still more severely punished. \"This news disturbed us, and when we heard that Pogomas had been arrested we felt certain he had denounced you in revenge for your having procured his dismissal from Nina\\'s house. When we heard that he had been let out and sent to Genoa, we expected to hear of your being set at liberty, as the authorities must have been satisfied of the genuine character of your passports; but you were still shut up, and Nina did not know what to think, and the count would not answer her when she made enquiries about you. She had made up her mind to say no more about it, when at last we heard you had been set free and that your passports had been declared genuine. \"Nina thought to see you in the pit of the opera–house, and made preparations for a triumph in her box; but she was in despair when she heard no performance was to be given.',\n",
       " 'In the evening the count told her that your passports had been returned with the order to leave in three days. The false creature praised her lover\\'s prudence to his face, but she cursed him in her heart. \"She knew you would not dare to see her, and when you left without writing her a note, she said you had received secret orders not to hold any further communications with her. \"\\'If Casanova had had the courage to ask me to go with him, I would have gone,\\' said she. \"Your man told her of your fortunate escape from three assassins. In the evening she congratulated Ricla on the circumstance, but he swore he knew nothing about it. You may thank God from the bottom of your heart that you ever left Spain alive after knowing Nina. She would have cost you your life at last, and she punishes me for having given her life. \" \"What! Are you her mother?\" \"Yes; Nina, that horrible woman, is my daughter. \" \"That is the horrible part of it, everybody is right.',\n",
       " '\" \"Explain yourself!\" \"Yes, though it is to my shame. She is my sister and my daughter, for she is the daughter of my father. \" \"What! your father loved you?\" \"I do not know whether the scoundrel loved me, but he treated me as his wife. She is the daughter of the crime, and God knows she is sufficient punishment for it. My father died to escape her vengeance; may he also escape the vengeance of God. I should have strangled her in her cradle, but maybe I shall strangle her yet. \" I remained dumb at the conclusion of this dreadful story, which bore all the marks of truth. \"Does Nina know that you are her mother?\" \"Her own father told her the secret when she was twelve, after he had initiated her into the life she has been living ever since. He would have made her a mother in her turn if he had not killed himself the same year, maybe to escape the gallows. \" \"How did the Conte de Ricla fall in love with her?\" \"It is a short story and a curious one.',\n",
       " 'Two years ago she came to Barcelona from Portugal, and was placed in one of the ballets for the sake of her pretty face, for as to talents she had none, and could only do the rebaltade (a sort of skip and pirouette) properly. \"The first evening she danced she was loudly applauded by the pit, for as she did the rebaltade she shewed her drawers up to her waist. In Spain any actress who shews her drawers on the stage is liable to a fine of a crown. Nina knew nothing about this, and, hearing the applause, treated the audience to another skip of the same kind, but at the end of the ballet she was told to pay two crowns for her immodesty. What do you think she did to elude the law, and at the same time avenge herself?\" \"Danced badly, perhaps. \" \"She danced without any drawers at all, and did her rebdltade as before, which caused such an effervescence of high spirits in the house as had never been known at Barcelona.',\n",
       " '\"The Conte de Ricla had seen her from his box, and was divided between horror and admiration, and sent for the inspector to tell him that this impudent creature must be punished. \\' \"Presently Nina appeared in the viceroy\\'s box, and asked him, impudently, what he wanted with her. \"\\'You are an immodest woman, and have failed in your duty to the public. \\' \"\\'What have I done? \"\\'You performed the same skip as before. \\' \"\\'Yes, but I haven\\'t broken your law, for no one can have seen my drawers as I took the precaution not to put any on. What more can I do for your cursed law, which has cost me two crowns already? Just tell me. \\' \"The viceroy and the great personages around him had much ado to refrain from laughter, for Nina was really in the right, and a serious discussion of the violated law would have been ridiculous. \"The viceroy felt he was in a false position, and merely said that if she ever danced without drawers again she should have a month\\'s imprisonment on bread and water.',\n",
       " '\"A week after one of my husband\\'s ballets was given. It was so well received that the audience encored it with enthusiasm. Ricla gave orders that the public should be satisfied, and all the dancers were told they would have to reappear. \"Nina, who was almost undressed, told my husband to do as best he could, as she was not going to dance again. As she had the chief part my husband could not do without her, and sent the manager to her dressing– room. She pushed the poor man out with so much violence that he fell against the wall of the passage, head foremost. \"The manager told his piteous tale to the viceroy, who ordered two soldiers to bring her before him. This was his ruin; for Nina is a beautiful woman, and in her then state of undress she would have seduced the coldest of men.',\n",
       " '\"The count reproved her, but his voice and his manner were ill–assured, and growing bolder as she watched his embarrassment, Nina replied that he might have her torn to pieces if he liked, but she would not dance against her will, and nowhere in her agreement was it stipulated that she should dance twice in the same evening, whether for his pleasure or anyone else\\'s. She also expressed her anger at making her appear before him in a state of semi–nudity, and swore she would never forgive his barbarous and despotic conduct. Let me go away, or kill me if you like; do your worst on me, and you shall find that I am a Venetian and a free woman!\\' \"The viceroy sat astonished, and said she must be mad. He then summoned my husband and told him she was no longer in his service. Nina was told she was free, and could go where she would. \"She went back to her dressing–room and came to us, where she was living.',\n",
       " '\"The ballet went on without her, and the poor viceroy sat in a dream, for the poison had entered into his veins. \"Next day a wretched singer named Molinari called on Nina and told her that the viceroy was anxious to know whether she were really mad or not, and would like to see her in a country house, the name of which he mentioned: this was just what the wretched woman wanted. \"\\'Tell his highness,\\' she said to Molinari, \\'that I will come, and that he will find me as gentle as a lamb and as good as an angel. \\' \"This is the way in which the connection began, and she fathomed his character so astutely that she maintained her conquest as much with ill– treatment and severity as with her favours. It was told with all the passion of an Italian divided between repentance for the past and the desire of vengeance. The next day, as I had expected, I received a letter from Henriette.',\n",

I am grateful for the reticence you have observed, though Marcoline must have delivered the message I gave her. Farewell!\" I replied, accepting her offer to correspond, and I told her the whole story of my adventures. From her I received forty letters, in which the history of her life is given. If she die before me, I shall add these letters to my Memoirs, but at present she is alive and happy, though advanced in years.

At Marseilles I met the Duc de Vilardi, who was kept alive by the art of Tronchin.

I left Marseilles by myself, and after crossing the Alps arrived at Turin. There I had a warm welcome from the Chevalier Raiberti and the Comte de la Perouse. Both of them pronounced me to be looking older, but I consoled myself with the thought that, after all, I was only forty–four.

       " 'If a Venetian had attempted to do so he would not have obtained permission from his Government to print it in the States of Venice, for the State policy is to allow no one to discuss the actions of the authorities, whether in praise or blame; consequently no writer had attempted to refute the French history, as it was well known that the refutation would be visited with punishment and not with reward. I had been persecuted by the Venetian Government, so no one could accuse me of being partial; and by my exposing the calumnies of Amelot before all Europe I hoped to gain a reward, which after all would only be an act of justice. I had been an exile for fourteen years, and I thought the Inquisitors would be glad to repair their injustice on the pretext of rewarding my patriotism. My readers will see that my hopes were fulfilled, but I had to wait for five more years instead of receiving permission to return at once.',\n",
       " 'de Bragadin was dead, and Dandolo and Barbaro were the only friends I had left at Venice; and with their aid I contrived to subscribe fifty copies of my book in my native town. Throughout my stay at Lugano I only frequented the house of M. de R―, where I saw the Abbe Riva, a learned and discreet man, to whom I had been commended by M. The abbe enjoyed such a reputation for wisdom amongst his fellow–countrymen that he was a kind of arbiter in all disputes, and thus the expenses of the law were saved. It was no wonder that the gentlemen of the long robe hated him most cordially. His nephew, Jean Baptiste Riva, was a friend of the Muses, of Bacchus, and of Venus; he was also a friend of mine, though I could not match him with the bottles. He lent me all the nymphs he had initiated into the mysteries, and they liked him all the better, as I made them some small presents. With him and his two pretty sisters I went to the Borromean Isles.',\n",
       " \"I knew that Count Borromeo, who had honoured me with his friendship at Turin, was there, and from him I felt certain of a warm welcome. One of the two sisters had to pass for Riva's wife, and the other for his sister–in–law. Although the count was a ruined man he lived in his isles like a prince. It would be impossible to describe these Islands of the Blest; they must be seen to be imagined. The inhabitants enjoy an everlasting spring; there is neither heat nor cold. The count regaled us choicely, and amused the two girls by giving them rods and lines and letting them fish. Although he was ugly, old, and ruined, he still possessed the art of pleasing. On the way back to Lugano, as I was making place for a carriage in a narrow road, my horse slipped and fell down a slope ten feet high. My head went against a large stone, and I thought my last hour was come as the blood poured out of the wound. During my stay at Lugano the inspectors of the Swiss cantons came there in its turn.\",\n",
       " 'The people dignified them with the magnificent title of ambassadors, but M. These gentlemen stayed at my inn, and I had my meals with them throughout their stay. The avoyer of Berne gave me some news of my poor friend M. His charming daughter Sara had become the wife of M, de V―, and was happy. A few days after these pleasant and cultured men had left, I was startled one morning by the sudden appearance of the wretched Marazzani in my room. I seized him by his collar, threw him out, and before he had time to use his cane or his sword, I had kicked, beaten, and boxed him most soundly. He defended himself to the best of his ability, and the landlord and his men ran up at the noise, and had some difficulty in separating us. \"Don\\'t let him go!\" I cried, \"send for the bargello and have him away to prison. \" I dressed myself hastily, and as I was going out to see M. de R―, the bargello met me, and asked me on what charge I gave the man into custody.',\n",
       " 'You may remember, reader, that I left the wretched fellow in the prison of Buen Retiro. I heard afterwards that the King of Spain, Jerusalem, and the Canary Islands, had given him a small post in a galley off the coast of Africa. He had done me no harm, and I pitied him; but not being his intimate friend, and having no power to mitigate the hardship of his lot, I had well–nigh forgotten him. Eight months after, I met at Barcelona Madame Bellucci, a Venetian dancer, with whom I had had a small intrigue. She gave an exclamation of delight on seeing me, and said she was glad to see me delivered from the hard fate to which a tyrannous Government had condemned me. \"What fate is that?\" I asked, \"I have seen a good deal of misfortune since I left you. \" \"But that has never been my lot, thank God! Who told you such a story?\" \"A Count Marazzani, who was here three weeks ago, and told me he had been luckier than you, as he had made his escape.',\n",
       " '\" \"He\\'s a liar and a scoundrel; and if ever I meet him again he shall pay me dearly. \" From that moment I never thought of the rascal without feeling a lively desire to give him a thrashing, but I never thought that chance would bring about so early a meeting. Under the circumstances I think my behaviour will be thought only natural. I seemed to have done nothing, and indeed, I had got as good as I gave. de R heard my statement he said he could neither keep him in prison nor drive him out of the town unless I laid a plea before him, craving protection against this man, whom I believed to have come to Lugano with the purpose of assassinating me. \"You can make the document more effective,\" he added, \"by placing your actual grievance in a strong light, and laying stress on his sudden appearance in your room without sending in his name. That\\'s what you had better do, and it remains to be seen how I shall answer your plea.',\n",
       " \"I shall ask him for his passport and delay the case, and order him to be severely treated; but in the end I shall only be able to drive him out of the town, unless he can find good bail. I sent in my plea, and the next day I had the pleasure of seeing him brought into the court bound hand and foot. de R began to examine him, and Marazzani swore he had no evil intentions in calling on me. As to the calumny, he protested he had only repeated common rumour, and professed his joy at finding it had been mistaken. This ought to have been enough for me, but I continued obdurate. de R― said the fact of my being sent to the galleys having been rumoured was no justification for his repeating it. Casanova's suspicion that you were going to assassinate him is justified by your giving a false name, for the plaintiff maintains that you are not Count Marazzani at all. He offers to furnish surety on this behalf, and if M. Casanova does you wrong, his bail will escheat to you as damages.\",\n",
       " 'In the mean time you will remain in prison till we have further information about your real status. \" He was taken back, and as the poor devil had not a penny in his pocket it would have been superfluous to tell the bargedlo to treat him severely. de R wrote to the Swiss agent at Parma to obtain the necessary information; but as the rascal knew this would be against him, he wrote me a humble letter, in which he confessed that he was the son of a poor shopkeeper of Bobbio, and although his name was really Marazzani, he had nothing to do with the Marazzanis of Plaisance. de R―, who let him out of prison with orders to leave Lugano in twenty–four hours. I thought I had been rather too harsh with him, and gave the poor devil some money to take him to Augsburg, and also a letter for M. de Sellentin, who was recruiting there for the Prussian king. The Chevalier de Breche came to the Lugano Fair to buy some horses, and stopped a fortnight.',\n",
       " \"de R―'s, for whose wife he had a great admiration, and I was sorry to see him go. I left Lugano myself a few days later, having made up my mind to winter in Turin, where I hoped to see some pleasant society. Before I left I received a friendly letter from Prince Lubomirski, with a bill for a hundred ducats, in payment of fifty copies of my book. The prince had become lord high marshal on the death of Count Bilinski. When I got to Turin I found a letter from the noble Venetian M. Girolamo Zulian, the same that had given me an introduction to Mocenigo. Berlendis, the representative of the Republic at Turin, who thanked me for having enabled him to receive me. The ambassador, a rich man, and a great lover of the fair sex, kept up a splendid establishment, and this was enough for his Government, for intelligence is not considered a necessary qualification for a Venetian ambassador.\",\n",
       " \"Indeed it is a positive disadvantage, and a witty ambassador would no doubt fall into disgrace with the Venetian Senate. However, Berlendis ran no risk whatever on this score; the realm of wit was an unknown land to him. I got this ambassador to call the attention of his Government to the work I had recently published, and the answer the State Inquisitors gave may astonish my readers, but it did not astonish me. The secretary of the famous and accursed Tribunal wrote to say that he had done well to call the attention of the Inquisitors to this work, as the author's presumption appeared on the title–page. He added that the work would be examined, and in the mean time the ambassador was instructed to shew me no signal marks of favour lest the Court should suppose he was protecting me as a Venetian. Nevertheless, it was the same tribunal that had facilitated my access to the ambassador to Madrid—Mocenigo.\",\n",
       " \"I told Berlendis that my visits should be limited in number, and free from all ostentation. I was much interested in his son's tutor; he was a priest, a man of letters, and a poet. His name was Andreis, and he is now resident in England, where he enjoys full liberty, the greatest of all blessings. I spent my time at Turin very pleasantly, in the midst of a small circle of Epicureans; there were the old Chevalier Raiberti, the Comte de la Perouse, a certain Abbe Roubien, a delightful man, the voluptuous Comte de Riva, and the English ambassador. To the amusements which this society afforded I added a course of reading, but no love affairs whatever. While I was at Turin, a milliner, Perouse's mistress, feeling herself in 'articulo mortis', swallowed the portrait of her lover instead of the Eucharist. This incident made me compose two sonnets, which pleased me a good deal at the time, and with which I am still satisfied.\",\n",
       " 'No doubt some will say that every poet is pleased with his own handiwork, but as a matter of fact, the severest critic of a sensible author is himself. The Russian squadron, under the command of Count Alexis Orloff, was then at Leghorn; this squadron threatened Constantinople, and would probably have taken it if an Englishman had been in command. As I had known Count Orloff in Russia, I imagined that I might possibly render myself of service to him, and at the same time make my fortune. The English ambassador having given me a letter for the English consul, I left Turin with very little money in my purse and no letter of credit on any banker. An Englishman named Acton commended me to an English banker at Leghorn, but this letter did not empower me to draw any supplies. Acton was just then involved in a curious complication. When he was at Venice he had fallen in love with a pretty woman, either a Greek or a Neapolitan.',\n",
       " 'The husband, by birth a native of Turin, and by profession a good–for–nothing, placed no obstacle in Acton\\'s way, as the Englishman was generous with his money; but he had a knack of turning up at those moments when his absence would have been most desirable. The generous but proud and impatient Englishman could not be expected to bear this for long. He consulted with the lady, and determined to shew his teeth. The husband persisted in his untimely visits, and one day Acton said, dryly,— \"Do you want a thousand guineas? You can have them if you like, on the condition that your wife travels with me for three years without our having the pleasure of your society. \" The husband thought the bargain a good one, and signed an agreement to that effect. After the three years were over the husband wrote to his wife, who was at Venice, to return to him, and to Acton to put no obstacle in the way.',\n",
       " 'The lady replied that she did not want to live with him any more, and Acton explained to the husband that he could not be expected to drive his mistress away against her will. He foresaw, however, that the husband would complain to the English ambassador, and determined to be before–handed with him. In due course the husband did apply to the English ambassador, requesting him to compel Acton to restore to him his lawful wife. He even asked the Chevalier Raiberti to write to the Commendatore Camarana, the Sardinian ambassador at Venice, to apply pressure on the Venetian Government, and he would doubtless have succeeded if M. However, as it was he did nothing of the sort, and even gave Acton a warm welcome when he came to Turin to look into the matter. He had left his mistress at Venice under the protection of the English consul.',\n",
       " \"The husband was ashamed to complain publicly, as he would have been confronted with the disgraceful agreement he had signed; but Berlendis maintained that he was in the right, and argued the question in the most amusing manner. On the one hand he urged the sacred and inviolable character of the marriage rite, and on the other he shewed how the wife was bound to submit to her husband in all things. I argued the matter with him myself, shewing him his disgraceful position in defending a man who traded on his wife's charms, and he was obliged to give in when I assured him that the husband had offered to renew the lease for the same time and on the same terms as before. Two years later I met Acton at Bologna, and admired the beauty whom he considered and treated as his wife. I left Turin for Parma with a Venetian who, like myself, was an exile from his country. He had turned actor to gain a livelihood; and was going to Parma with two actresses, one of whom was interesting.\",\n",
       " 'As soon as I found out who he was, we became friends, and he would have gladly made me a partner in all his amusements, by the way, if I had been in the humour to join him. This journey to Leghorn was undertaken under the influence of chimerical ideas. I thought I might be useful to Count Orloff, in the conquest he was going to make, as it was said, of Constantinople. I fancied that it had been decreed by fate that without me he could never pass through the Dardanelles. In spite of the wild ideas with which my mind was occupied, I conceived a warm friendship for my travelling companion, whose name was Angelo Bentivoglio. The Government never forgave him a certain crime, which to the philosophic eye appears a mere trifle. In four years later, when I describe my stay at Venice, I shall give some further account of him. About noon we reached Parma, and I bade adieu to Bentivoglio and his friends.',\n",
       " 'The Court was at Colorno, but having nothing to gain from this mockery of a court, and wishing to leave for Bologna the next morning, I asked Dubois–Chateleraux, Chief of the Mint, and a talented though vain man, to give me some dinner. The reader will remember that I had known him twenty two years before, when I was in love with Henriette. He was delighted to see me, and seemed to set great store by my politeness in giving him the benefit of my short stay at Parma. I told him that Count Orloff was waiting for me at Leghorn, and that I was obliged to travel day and night. \"He will be setting sail before long,\" said he; \"I have advices from Leghorn to that effect. \" I said in a mysterious tone of voice that he would not sail without me, and I could see that my host treated me with increased respect after this. He wanted to discuss the Russian Expedition, but my air of reserve made him change the conversation.',\n",
       " 'At dinner we talked a good deal about Henriette, whom he said he had succeeded in finding out; but though he spoke of her with great respect, I took care not to give him any information on the subject. He spent the whole afternoon in uttering complaints against the sovereigns of Europe, the King of Prussia excepted, as he had made him a baron, though I never could make out why. He cursed the Duke of Parma who persisted in retaining his services, although there was no mint in existence in the duchy, and his talents were consequently wasted there. I listened to all his complaints, and agreed that Louis XV. had been ungrateful in not conferring the Order of St. Michael on him; that Venice had rewarded his services very shabbily; that Spain was stingy, and Naples devoid of honesty, etc. When he had finished, I asked him if he could give me a bill on a banker for fifty sequins.',\n",
       " \"He replied in the most friendly manner that he would not give me the trouble of going to a banker for such a wretched sum as that; he would be delighted to oblige me himself. I took the money promising to repay him at an early date, but I have never been able to do so. I do not know whether he is alive or dead, but if he were to attain the age of Methuselah I should not entertain any hopes of paying him; for I get poorer every day, and feel that my end is not far off. The next day I was in Bologna, and the day after in Florence, where I met the Chevalier Morosini, nephew of the Venetian procurator, a young man of nineteen, who was travelling with Count Stratico, professor of mathematics at the University of Padua. He gave me a letter for his brother, a Jacobin monk, and professor of literature at Pisa, where I stopped for a couple of hours on purpose to make the celebrated monk's acquaintance.\",\n",
       " 'I found him even greater than his fame, and promised to come again to Pisa, and make a longer stay for the purpose of enjoying his society. I stopped an hour at the Wells, where I made the acquaintance of the Pretender to the throne of Great Britain, and from there went on to Leghorn, where I found Count Orloff still waiting, but only because contrary winds kept him from sailing. The English consul, with whom he was staying, introduced me at once to the Russian admiral, who received me with expressions of delight. He told me he would be charmed if I would come on board with him. He told me to have my luggage taken off at once, as he would set sail with the first fair wind. When he was gone the English consul asked me what would be my status with the admiral. \"That\\'s just what I mean to find out before embarking my effects. \" \"You won\\'t be able to speak to him till to–morrow.',\n",
       " '\" Next morning I called on Count Orloff, and sent him in a short note, asking him to give me a short interview before I embarked my mails. An officer came out to tell me that the admiral was writing in bed, and hoped I would wait. \" I had been waiting a few minutes, when Da Loglio, the Polish agent at Venice and an old friend of mine, came in. \"What are you doing here, my dear Casanova?\" said he. \" After this, Da Loglio coolly went into the admiral\\'s room. This was impertinent of him; it was as if he said in so many words that the admiral was too busy to see me, but not too busy to see him. A moment after, Marquis Manucci came in with his order of St. He congratulated me on my visit to Leghorn, and then said he had read my work on Venice, and had been surprised to find himself in it. He had some reason for surprise, for there was no connection between him and the subject–matter; but he should have discovered before that the unexpected often happens.',\n",
       " 'He did not give me time to tell him so, but went into the admiral\\'s room as Da Loglio had done. I was vexed to see how these gentlemen were admitted while I danced attendance, and the project of sailing with Orloff began to displease me. In five hours Orloff came out followed by a numerous train. He told me pleasantly that we could have our talk at table or after dinner. He came in and sat down at two o\\'clock, and I was among the guests. Orloff kept on saying, \"Eat away, gentlemen, eat away;\" and read his correspondence and gave his secretary letters all the time. After dinner he suddenly glanced up at me, and taking me by the hand led me to the window, and told me to make haste with my luggage, as he should sail before the morning if the wind kept up. \"Quite so; but kindly tell me, count, what is to be my status or employment an board your ship?\" \"At present I have no special employ to give you; that will come in time.',\n",
       " '\" \"The offer is an honourable one so far as you are concerned, but all the other officers might treat me with contempt. I should be regarded as a kind of fool, and I should probably kill the first man who dared to insult me. Give me a distinct office, and let me wear your uniform; I will be useful to you. I know the country for which you are bound, I can speak the language, and I am not wanting in courage. \" \"My dear sir, I really have no particular office to give you. \" \"Then, count, I wish you a pleasant sail; I am going to Rome. I hope you may never repent of not taking me, for without me you will never pass the Dardanelles. \" Such was the short dialogue I had with the worthy count, who, as a matter of fact, did not pass the Dardanelles. Whether he would have succeeded if I had been on board is more than I can say.',\n",
       " 'The day after I went to Pisa, and spent a pleasant week in the company of Father Stratico, who was made a bishop two or three years after by means of a bold stroke that might have ruined him. He delivered a funeral oration over Father Ricci, the last general of the Jesuits. The Pope, Ganganelli, had the choice of punishing the writer and increasing the odium of many of the faithful, or of rewarding him handsomely. I saw the bishop some years later, and he told me in confidence that he had only written the oration because he felt certain, from his knowledge of the human heart, that his punishment would be a great reward. This clever monk initiated me into all the charms of Pisan society. He had organized a little choir of ladies of rank, remarkable for their intelligence and beauty, and had taught them to sing extempore to the guitar. He had had them instructed by the famous Gorilla, who was crowned poetess–laureate at the capitol by night, six years later.',\n",
       " 'She was crowned where our great Italian poets were crowned; and though her merit was no doubt great, it was, nevertheless, more tinsel than gold, and not of that order to place her on a par with Petrarch or Tasso. She was satirised most bitterly after she had received the bays; and the satirists were even more in the wrong than the profaners of the capitol, for all the pamphlets against her laid stress on the circumstance that chastity, at all events, was not one of her merits. All poetesses, from the days of Homer to our own, have sacrificed on the altar of Venus. No one would have heard of Gorilla if she had not had the sense to choose her lovers from the ranks of literary men; and she would never have been crowned at Rome if she had not succeeded in gaining over Prince Gonzaga Solferino, who married the pretty Mdlle. Rangoni, daughter of the Roman consul, whom I knew at Marseilles, and of whom I have already spoken.',\n",
       " 'This coronation of Gorilla is a blot on the pontificate of the present Pope, for henceforth no man of genuine merit will accept the honour which was once so carefully guarded by the giants of human intellect. Two days after the coronation Gorilla and her admirers left Rome, ashamed of what they had done. The Abbe Pizzi, who had been the chief promoter of her apotheosis, was so inundated with pamphlets and satires that for some months he dared not shew his face. This is a long digression, and I will now return to Father Stratico, who made the time pass so pleasantly for me. Though he was not a handsome man, he possessed the art of persuasion to perfection; and he succeeded in inducing me to go to Sienna, where he said I should enjoy myself. He gave me a letter of introduction for the Marchioness Chigi, and also one for the Abbe Chiaccheri; and as I had nothing better to do I went to Sienna by the shortest way, not caring to visit Florence.',\n",
       " 'The Abbe Chiaccheri gave me a warm welcome, and promised to do all he could to amuse me; and he kept his word. He introduced me himself to the Marchioness Chigi, who took me by storm as soon as she had read the letter of the Abbe Stratico, her dear abbe, as she called him, when she read the superscription in his writing. The marchioness was still handsome, though her beauty had begun to wane; but with her the sweetness, the grace, and the ease of manner supplied the lack of youth. She knew how to make a compliment of the slightest expression, and was totally devoid of any affection of superiority. \"So you are going to stay a week, I see, from the dear abbe\\'s letter. That\\'s a short time for us, but perhaps it may be too long for you. I hope the abbe has not painted us in too rosy colours. \" \"He only told me that I was to spend a week here, and that I should find with you all the charms of intellect and sensibility. \" \"Stratico should have condemned you to a month without mercy.',\n",
       " '\" \"Why mercy? What hazard do I run?\" \"Of being tired to death, or of leaving some small morsel of your heart at Sienna. \" \"All that might happen in a week, but I am ready to dare the danger, for Stratico has guarded me from the first by counting on you, and from the second by counting on myself. My heart will go forth from Sienna as free as it came, for I have no hope of victory, and defeat would make me wretched. \" \"Is it possible that you are amongst the despairing?\" \"Yes, and to that fact I owe my happiness. \" \"It would be a pity for you if you found yourself mistaken. \\'Tis likewise the motto of that finished voluptuary, Horace, but I only take it because it suits me. The pleasure which follows desires is the best, for it is the most acute. \"True, but it cannot be calculated on, and defies the philosopher. May God preserve you, madam, from finding out this painful truth by experience! The highest good lies in enjoyment; desire too often remains unsatisfied.',\n",
       " 'If you have not yet found out the truth of Horace\\'s maxim, I congratulate you. \" The amiable marchioness smiled pleasantly and gave no positive answer. Chiaccheri now opened his mouth for the first time, and said that the greatest happiness he could wish us was that we should never agree. The marchioness assented, rewarding Chiaccheri with a smile, but I could not do so. \"I had rather contradict you,\" I said, \"than renounce all hopes of pleasing you. The abbe has thrown the apple of discord between us, but if we continue as we have begun I shall take up my abode at Sienna. \" The marchioness was satisfied with the sample of her wit which she had given me, and began to talk commonplaces, asking me if I should like to see company and enjoy society of the fair sex. \"I want to leave Sienna with the feeling that you are the only lady to whom I have done homage, and that the Abbe Chiaccheri has been my only guide.',\n",
       " '\" The marchioness was flattered, and asked the abbe and myself to dine with her on the following day in a delightful house she had at a hundred paces from the town. The older I grew the more I became attached to the intellectual charms of women. With the sensualist, the contrary takes place; he becomes more material in his old age: requires women well taught in Venus\\'s shrines, and flies from all mention of philosophy. As I was leaving her I told the abbe that if I stayed at Sienna I would see no other woman but her, come what might, and he agreed that I was very right. The abbe shewed me all the objects of interest in Sienna, and introduced me to the literati, who in their turn visited me. The same day Chiaccheri took me to a house where the learned society assembled. It was the residence of two sisters—the elder extremely ugly and the younger very pretty, but the elder sister was accounted, and very rightly, the Corinna of the place.',\n",
       " 'She asked me to give her a specimen of my skill, promising to return the compliment. I recited the first thing that came into my head, and she replied with a few lines of exquisite beauty. I complimented her, but Chiaccheri (who had been her master) guessed that I did not believe her to be the author, and proposed that we should try bouts rimes. The pretty sister gave out the rhymes, and we all set to work. The ugly sister finished first, and when the verses came to be read, hers were pronounced the best. I was amazed, and made an improvisation on her skill, which I gave her in writing. In five minutes she returned it to me; the rhymes were the same, but the turn of the thought was much more elegant. I was still more surprised, and took the liberty of asking her name, and found her to be the famous \"Shepherdess,\" Maria Fortuna, of the Academy of Arcadians. I had read the beautiful stanzas she had written in praise of Metastasio.',\n",
       " \"I told her so, and she brought me the poet's reply in manuscript. Full of admiration, I addressed myself to her alone, and all her plainness vanished. I had had an agreeable conversation with the marchioness in the morning, but in the evening I was literally in an ecstacy. I kept on talking of Fortuna, and asked the abbe if she could improvise in the manner of Gorilla. He replied that she had wished to do so, but that he had disallowed it, and he easily convinced me that this improvisation would have been the ruin of her fine talent. I also agreed with him when he said that he had warned her against making impromptus too frequently, as such hasty verses are apt to sacrifice wit to rhyme. The honour in which improvisation was held amongst the Greeks and Romans is due to the fact that Greek and Latin verse is not under the dominion of rhyme. But as it was, the great poets seldom improvised; knowing as they did that such verses were usually feeble and common–place.\",\n",
       " 'Horace often passed a whole night searching for a vigorous and elegantly–turned phrase. When he had succeeded, he wrote the words on the wall and went to sleep. The lines which cost him nothing are generally prosaic; they may easily be picked out in his epistles. The amiable and learned Abbe Chiaccheri, confessed to me that he was in love with his pupil, despite her ugliness. He added that he had never expected it when he began to teach her to make verses. \"I can\\'t understand that,\" I said, \"sublata lucerna\\', you know. \" \"Not at all,\" said he, with a laugh, \"I love her for her face, since it is inseparable from my idea of her. \" A Tuscan has certainly more poetic riches at his disposal than any other Italian, and the Siennese dialect is sweeter and more energetic than that of Florence, though the latter claims the title of the classic dialect, on account of its purity. This purity, together with its richness and copiousness of diction it owes to the academy.',\n",
       " 'From the great richness of Italian we can treat a subject with far greater eloquence than a French writer; Italian abounds in synonyms, while French is lamentably deficient in this respect. Voltaire used to laugh at those who said that the French tongue could not be charged with poverty, as it had all that was necessary. The obstinacy of the French academy in refusing to adopt foreign words skews more pride than wisdom. As for us we take words from all languages and all sources, provided they suit the genius of our own language. We love to see our riches increase; we even steal from the poor, but to do so is the general characteristic of the rich. The amiable marchioness gave us a delicious dinner in a house designed by Palladio. Chiaccheri had warned me to say nothing about the Shepherdess Fortuna; but at dinner she told him she was sure he had taken me to her house.

       " '\"Stratico admires Fortuna,\" said the marchioness, \"and I confess that her writings have great merit, but it\\'s a pity one cannot go to the house, except under an incognito. \"What!\" said she to the abbe, \"you did not tell him whose house it is?\" \"I did not think it necessary, her father and mother rarely shew themselves. \" \"But what is her father?\" I asked, \"the hangman, perhaps?\" \"Worse, he\\'s the \\'bargello\\', and you must see that a stranger cannot be received into good society here if he goes to such places as that. \" Chiaccheri looked rather hurt, and I thought it my duty to say that I would not go there again till the eve of my departure. \"I saw her sister once,\" said the marchioness; \"she is really charmingly pretty, and it\\'s a great pity that with her beauty and irreproachable morality she should be condemned to marry a man of her father\\'s class.',\n",
       " '\" \"I once knew a man named Coltellini,\" I replied; \"he is the son of the bargello of Florence, and is poet–in–ordinary to the Empress of Russia. I shall try to make a match between him and Fortuna\\'s sister; he is a young man of the greatest talents. \" The marchioness thought my idea an excellent one, but soon after I heard that Coltellini was dead. The \\'bargello\\' is a cordially–detested person all over Italy, if you except Modena, where the weak nobility make much of the \\'bargello\\', and do justice to his excellent table. This is a curious fact, for as a rule these bargellos are spies, liars, traitors, cheats, and misanthropes, for a man despised hates his despisers. At Sienna I was shewn a Count Piccolomini, a learned and agreeable man. He had a strange whim, however, of spending six months in the year in the strictest seclusion in his own house, never going out and never seeing any company; reading and working the whole time.',\n",
       " 'He certainly did his best to make up for his hibernation during the other six months in the year. The marchioness promised she would come to Rome in the course of the summer. She had there an intimate friend in Bianconi who had abandoned the practice of medicine, and was now the representative of the Court of Saxony. On the eve of my departure, the driver who was to take me to Rome came and asked me if I would like to take a travelling companion, and save myself three sequins. \" \"Is she by herself?\" \"No, she is with a gentleman on horseback, who wishes to ride all the way to Rome. \" \"Then how did the girl come here?\" \"On horseback, but she is tired out, and cannot bear it any longer. The gentleman has offered me four sequins to take her to Rome, and as I am a poor man I think you might let me earn the money. \" \"I suppose he will follow the carriage?\" \"He can go as he likes; that can\\'t make much difference to either of us. \" \"I have been told so, but I haven\\'t seen her myself.',\n",
       " '\" \"What sort of a man is her companion?\" \"He\\'s a fine man, but he can speak very little Italian. \" \"Has he sold the lady\\'s horse?\" \"No, it was hired. He has only one trunk, which will go behind the carriage. I shall not give any decision before speaking to this man. \" Directly afterwards, a brisk–looking young fellow, carrying himself well enough, and clad in a fancy uniform, came in. He told me the tale I had heard from the coachman, and ended by saying that he was sure I would not refuse to accommodate his wife in my carriage. \"Your wife, sir?\" I saw he was a Frenchman, and I addressed him in French. \" The next morning when I got into my carriage, I found her already there. I paid her some slight compliment, and sat down beside her, and we drove off.',\n",
       " \"Chapter VI Miss Betty--the Comte De L'etoile--sir B * * * M * * *--reassured This was the fourth adventure I had had of this kind. There is nothing particularly out of the common in having a fellow–traveller in one's carriage; this time, however, the affair had something decidedly romantic about it. I was forty–five, and my purse contained two hundred sequins. I still loved the fair sex, though my ardour had decreased, my experience had ripened, and my caution increased. I was more like a heavy father than a young lover, and I limited myself to pretensions of the most modest character. The young person beside me was pretty and gentle–looking, she was neatly though simply dressed in the English fashion, she was fair and small, and her budding breast could be seen outlined beneath the fine muslin of her dress. She had all the appearances of modesty and noble birth, and something of virginal innocence, which inspired one with attachment and respect at the same time.\",\n",
       " '\" \"I congratulate myself on having you for my travelling companion. \" \"Yes, but I will never do such a foolish thing again. \" \"I think your husband would have been wise to sell his horse and buy a carriage. \" \"You like travelling?\" \"Very much, but with greater comfort. \" With these words the English girl, whose white skin did not look as if it could contain a drop of blood, blushed most violently. I guessed something of her secret, and begged pardon; and for more than an hour I remain silent, pretending to gaze at the scenery, but in reality thinking of her, for she began to inspire me with a lively interest. Though the position of my young companion was more than equivocal, I determined to see my way clearly before I took any decisive step; and I waited patiently till we got to Bon Couvent, where we expected to dine and meet the husband. In Italy the carriages never go faster than a walk; a man on foot can outstrip them, as they rarely exceed three miles an hour.',\n",
       " 'The tedium of a journey under such circumstances is something dreadful, and in the hot months one has to stop five or six hours in the middle of the day to avoid falling ill. Quirico, where there was an excellent inn, that night, so he proposed waiting at Bon Couvent till four o\\'clock. The English girl was astonished at not finding her husband, and looked for him in all directions. I noticed her, and asked the landlord what had become of him. He informed us that he had breakfasted and baited his horse, and had then gone on, leaving word that he would await us at St. The poor girl begged me to excuse her husband\\'s behaviour. \"He has given me a mark of his confidence, madam, and there is nothing to be offended at. \" The landlord asked me if the vetturino paid my expenses, and I answered in the negative; and the girl then told him to ask the vetturino if he was paying for her.',\n",
       " 'The man came in, and to convince the lady that providing her with meals was not in the contract, he gave her a paper which she handed to me to read. \" When she was alone with me my young companion begged me only to order dinner for myself. I understood her delicacy, and this made her all the dearer to me. \"Madame,\" said I, \"you must please look upon me as an old friend. I guess you have no money about you, and that you wish to fast from motives of delicacy. If I told the landlord to only prepare dinner for myself I should be dishonouring the count, yourself possibly, and myself most of all. Let dinner be served for two, then; but I cannot eat, for I feel ill, and I hope you will not mind my lying on the bed for a moment. This is a pleasant room, and they can lay the table in the next. Lie down, and sleep if you can, and I will order dinner to be ready by two. \" I left her without giving her time to answer, and went to order dinner.',\n",
       " 'I had ceased to believe the Frenchman to be the beautiful Englishwoman\\'s husband, and began to think I should have to fight him. The case, I felt certain, was one of elopement and seduction; and, superstitious as usual, I was sure that my good genius had sent me in the nick of time to save her and care for her, and in short to snatch her from the hands of her infamous deceiver. I laughed at the absurd title the rascal had given himself, and when the thought struck me that he had possibly abandoned her to me altogether, I made up my mind that he deserved hanging. I lay down on the bed, and as I built a thousand castles in the air I fell asleep. The landlady awoke me softly, saying that three o\\'clock had struck. \" I opened the door gently, and saw she was still asleep, but as I closed the door after me the noise awoke her, and she asked if I had dined. \"I shall not take any dinner, madam, unless you do me the honour to dine with me.',\n",
       " 'You have had a five hours\\' rest, and I hope you are better. \" \"I will sit down with you to dinner, as you wish it. \" \"That makes me happy, and I will order dinner to be served forthwith. \" She ate little, but what little she did eat was taken with a good appetite. She was agreeably surprised to see the beefsteaks and plum pudding, which I had ordered for her. When the landlady came in, she asked her if the cook was an Englishman, and when she heard that I had given directions for the preparation of her national dishes, she seemed full of gratitude. She cheered up, and congratulated me on my appetite, while I encouraged her to drink some excellent Montepulciano and Montefiascone. By dessert she was in good spirits, while I felt rather excited. She told me, in Italian, that she was born in London, and I thought I should have died with joy, in reply to my question whether she knew Madame Cornelis, she replied that she had known her daughter as they had been at school together.',\n",
       " '\"Has Sophie grown tall?\" \"No, she is quite small, but she is very pretty, and so clever. \" As she said this she blushed and lowered her eyes. I scarcely like to say it, but Sophie is the very image of you. \" \"Why should you hesitate to say so? It has been remarked to me before. How long ago is it since you have seen her?\" \"Eighteen months; she went back to her mother\\'s, to be married as it was said, but I don\\'t know to whom. \" The landlord brought me the bill, and I saw a note of three pains which her husband had spent on himself and his horse. I was delighted to see her blushing, it proved she was not a party to her husband\\'s proceedings. I was burning with the desire to know how she had left London and had met the Frenchman, and why they were going to Rome; but I did not want to trouble her by my questions, and I loved her too well already to give her any pain. We had a three hours\\' drive before us, so I turned the conversation to Sophie, with whom she had been at school.',\n",
       " '\"Was Miss Nancy Steyne there when you left?\" said I. The reader may remember how fond I had been of this young lady, who had dined with me, and whom I had covered with kisses, though she was only twelve. My companion sighed at hearing the name of Nancy, and told me that she had left. \"Was she pretty when you knew her?\" \"She was a beauty, but her loveliness was a fatal gift to her. Nancy was a close friend of mine, we loved each other tenderly; and perhaps our sympathy arose from the similarity of the fate in store for us. Nancy, too loving and too simple, is now, perhaps, even more unhappy than myself. \" \"More unhappy? What do you mean?\" \"Alas!\" \"Is it possible that fate has treated you harshly? Is it possible that you can be unhappy with such a letter of commendation as nature has given you?\" \"Alas! let us speak of something else. I pitied her in secret, and led the conversation back to Nancy.',\n",
       " '\" \"She ran away with a young man she loved; they despaired of gaining the parents\\' consent to the match. Since her flight nothing has been heard of her, and you see I have some reason to fear that she is unhappy. I would willingly give my life if it could be the saving of her. She and Sophie dined with me, and her father came in at the end of the meal. I heard that you had gone to Russia, and had fought a duel with a general in Poland. Is this true? How I wish I could tell dear Sophie all this, but I may not entertain such hopes now. \" \"You have heard the truth about me; but what should prevent you writing what you like to England? I take a lively interest in you, trust in me, and I promise you that you shall communicate with whom you please. \" With these words she became silent, and I left her to her thoughts.',\n",
       " \"Quirico, and the so–called Comte de l'Etoile came out and welcomed his wife in the most loving fashion, kissing her before everybody, no doubt with the object of giving people to understand that she was his wife, and I her father. The girl responded to all his caresses, looking as if a load had been lifted off her breast, and without a word of reproach she went upstairs with him, having apparently forgotten my existence. I set that down to love, youth, and the forgetfulness natural to that early age. I went upstairs in my turn with my carpet bag, and supper was served directly, as we had to start very early the next morning if we wished to reach Radicofani before the noonday heat. We had an excellent supper, as the count had preceded us by six hours, and the landlord had had plenty of time to make his preparations. The English girl seemed as much in love with de l'Etoile as he with her, and I was left completely out in the cold.\",\n",
       " 'I cannot describe the high spirits, the somewhat risky sallies, and the outrageous humours of the young gentleman; the girl laughed with all her heart, and I could not help laughing too. I considered that I was present at a kind of comedy, and not a gesture, not a word, not a laugh did I allow to escape me. \"He may be merely a rich and feather–brained young officer,\" I said to myself, \"who treats everything in this farcical manner. They are amusing, but frivolous, and sometimes dangerous, wearing their honour lightly, and too apt to carry it at the sword\\'s point. \" On this hypothesis I was ill pleased with my position. I did not much like his manner towards myself; he seemed to be making a dupe of me, and behaved all the while as if he were doing me an honour. On the supposition that the Englishwoman was his wife, his treatment of myself was certainly not warranted, and I was not the man to play zero.',\n",
       " 'I could not disguise the fact, however, that any onlooker would have pronounced me to be playing an inferior part. There were two beds in the room where we had our supper. When the chambermaid came to put on the sheets, I told her to give me another room. The count politely begged me to sleep in the same room with them, and the lady remained neutral; but I did not much care for their company, and insisted on leaving them alone. I had my carpet bag taken to my room, wished them a good night and locked myself in. My friends had only one small trunk, whence I concluded that they had sent on their luggage by another way; but they did not even have the trunk brought up to their room. I went to bed tranquilly, feeling much less interested about the lady than I had been on the journey. I was roused early in the morning, and made a hasty toilette. I could hear my neighbours dressing, so I half opened my door, and wished them good day without going into their room.',\n",
       " 'In a quarter of an hour I heard the sound of a dispute in the court– yard, and on looking out, there were the Frenchman and the vetturino arguing hotly. The vetturino held the horse\\'s bridle, and the pretended count did his best to snatch it away from him. I guessed the bone of contention: the Frenchman had no money, and the vetturino asked in vain for his due. I knew that I should be drawn into the dispute, and was making up my mind to do my duty without mercy, when the Count de l\\'Etoile came in and said,— \"This blockhead does not understand what I say to him; but as he may have right on his side, I must ask you to give him two sequins. By an odd chance I happen to have no money about me, but the fellow might trust me as he has got my trunk. However, he says he must be paid, so will you kindly oblige me? You shall hear more of me at Rome. \" Without waiting for me to reply, the rascal went out and ran down the stairs.',\n",
       " 'I put my head out of the window, and saw him leap on horseback and gallop away. I sat down on my bed, and turned the scene over in my mind, rubbing my hands gently. At last I went off into a mad roar of laughter; it struck me as so whimsical and original an adventure. \"Laugh too,\" said I to the lady, \"laugh or I will never get up. \" \"I agree with you that it\\'s laughable enough, but I have not the spirit to laugh. \" I gave the poor devil of a vetturino two sequins, telling him that I should like some coffee and to start in a quarter of an hour. \"I understand your grief,\" said I, \"but you must try to overcome it. I have only one favour to ask of you, and if you refuse to grant me that, I shall be as sad as you, so we shall be rather a melancholy couple. \" \"What can I do for you?\" \"You can tell me on your word of honour whether that extraordinary character is your husband, or only your lover. \" \"I will tell you the simple truth; he is not my husband, but we are going to be married at Rome.',\n",
       " 'He never shall be your husband, and so much the better for you. He has seduced you, and you love him, but you will soon get over that. I am sure he has told you that he is rich, that he is a man of rank, and that he will make you happy; and all that is a lie. \" \"How can you know all this?\" \"Experience—experience is my great teacher. Your lover is a young feather–brain, a man of no worth. He might possibly marry you, but it would be only to support himself by the sale of your charms. \" \"Yes, he loves you, but not with the love of a man of honour. Without knowing my name, or my character, or anything about me, he delivered you over to my tender mercies. A man of any delicacy would never abandon his loved one thus. \" \"A man of honour is the same in France, and England, and Italy, and all the world over. If he loved you, would he have left you penniless in this fashion? What would you do, if I were inclined to play the brutal lover? You may speak freely.',\n",
       " '\" \"Very good; then I should abandon you here, and what would you do then? You are pretty, you are a woman of sensibility, but many men would take but little account of your virtue. Your lover has left you to me; for all he knew I might be the vilest wretch; but as it is, cheer up, you have nothing to fear. \"How can you think that adventurer loves you? He is a mere monster. I am sorry that what I say makes you weep, but it must be said. I even dare tell you that I have taken a great liking to you; but you may feel quite sure that I shall not ask you to give me so much as a kiss, and I will never abandon you. Before we get to Rome I shall convince you that the count, as he calls himself, not only does not love you, but is a common swindler as well as a deceiver. \" \"You will convince me of that?\" \"Yes, on my word of honour! Dry your eyes, and let us try to make this day pass as pleasantly as yesterday. You cannot imagine how glad I feel that chance has constituted me your protector.',\n",
       " 'I want you to feel assured of my friendship, and if you do not give me a little love in return, I will try and bear it patiently. \" The landlord came in and brought the bill for the count and his mistress as well as for myself. I had expected this, and paid it without a word, and without looking at the poor wandering sheep beside me. I recollected that too strong medicines kill, and do not cure, and I was afraid I had said almost too much. I longed to know her history, and felt sure I should hear it before we reached Rome. We took some coffee and departed, and not a word passed between us till we got to the inn at La Scala, where we got down. The road from La Scala to Radicofani is steep and troublesome. The vetturino would require an extra horse, and even then would have taken four hours. I decided, therefore, to take two post horses, and not to begin the journey till ten o\\'clock. \"Would it not be better to go on now?\" said the English girl; \"it will be very hot from ten till noon.',\n",
       " '\" \"Yes, but the Comte de l\\'Ltoile, whom we should be sure to meet at Radicofani, would not like to see me. \" If I had told her my reason she would have wept anew, so in pity I spared her. I saw that she was blinded by love, and could not see the true character of her lover. It would be impossible to cure her by gentle and persuasive argument; I must speak sharply, the wound must be subjected to the actual cautery. But was virtue the cause of all this interest? Was it devotion to a young and innocent girl that made me willing to undertake so difficult and so delicate a task? Doubtless these motives went for something, but I will not attempt to strut in borrowed plumes, and must freely confess that if she had been ugly and stupid I should probably have left her to her fate. In short, selfishness was at the bottom of it all, so let us say no more about virtue. My true aim was to snatch this delicate morsel from another\\'s hand that I might enjoy it myself.',\n",
       " 'I did not confess as much to myself, for I could never bear to calmly view my own failings, but afterwards I came to the conclusion that I acted a part throughout. Is selfishness, then, the universal motor of our actions? I am afraid it is. I made Betty (such was her name) take a country walk with me, and the scenery there is so beautiful that no poet nor painter could imagine a more delicious prospect. Betty spoke Tuscan with English idioms and an English accent, but her voice was so silvery and clear that her Italian was delightful to listen to. I longed to kiss her lips as they spoke so sweetly, but I respected her and restrained myself. We were walking along engaged in agreeable converse, when all at once we heard the church bells peal out. Betty said she had never seen a Catholic service, and I was glad to give her that pleasure.',\n",
       " \"It was the feast day of some local saint, and Betty assisted at high mass with all propriety, imitating the gestures of the people, so that no one would have taken her for a Protestant. After it was over, she said she thought the Catholic rite was much more adapted to the needs of loving souls than the Angelican. She was astonished at the southern beauty of the village girls, whom she pronounced to be much handsomer that the country lasses in England. She asked me the time, and I replied without thinking that I wondered she had not got a watch. She blushed and said the count had asked her to give it him to leave in pawn for the horse he hired. I was sorry for what I had said, for I had put Betty, who was incapable of a lie, to great pain. We started at ten o'clock with three horses, and as a cool wind was blowing we had a pleasant drive, arriving at Radicofani at noon.\",\n",
       " 'The landlord, who was also the postmaster, asked if I would pay three pauls which the Frenchman had expended for his horse and himself, assuring the landlord that his friend would pay. For Betty\\'s sake I said I would pay; but this was not all. \"The gentleman,\" added the man, \"has beaten three of my postillions with his naked sword. One of them was wounded in the face, and he has followed his assailant, and will make him pay dearly for it. The reason of the assault was that they wanted to detain him till he had paid. \" \"You were wrong to allow violence to be used; he does not look like a thief, and you might have taken it for granted that I should pay. \" \"You are mistaken; I was not obliged to take anything of the sort for granted; I have been cheated in this sort many times before. She observed a distressed silence; and I tried to raise her spirits, and to make her eat a good dinner, and to taste the excellent Muscat, of which the host had provided an enormous flask.',\n",
       " 'All my efforts were in vain, so I called the vetturino to tell him that I wanted to start directly after dinner. \"You mean to go as far as Centino, I suppose,\" said the man. \" \"No, we must push on, as the lady\\'s husband may be in need of help. The wounded postillion has followed him; and as he speaks Italian very imperfectly, there\\'s no knowing what may happen to him. \" Betty looked at me with the utmost gratitude; and by way of proving it, she pretended to have a good appetite. She had noticed that this was a certain way of pleasing me. While we were at dinner I ordered up one of the beaten postillions, and heard his story. He was a frank rogue; he said he had received some blows with the flat of the sword, but he boasted of having sent a stone after the Frenchman which must have made an impression on him.',\n",
       " \"I gave him a Paul, and promised to make it a crown if he would go to Centino to bear witness against his comrade, and he immediately began to speak up for the count, much to Betty's amusement. He said the man's wound in the face was a mere scratch, and that he had brought it on himself, as he had no business to oppose a traveller as he had done. By way of comfort he told us that the Frenchman had only been hit by two or three stones. Betty did not find this very consoling, but I saw that the affair was more comic than tragic, and would end in nothing. The postillion went off, and we followed him in half an hour. Betty was tranquil enough till we got there, and heard that the count had gone on to Acquapendente with the two postillions at his heels; she seemed quite vexed. I told her that all would be well; that the count knew how to defend himself; but she only answered me with a deep sigh.\",\n",
       " 'I suspected that she was afraid we should have to pass the night together, and that I would demand some payment for all the trouble I had taken. \"Would you like us to go on to Acquapendente?\" I asked her. At this question her face beamed all over; she opened her arms, and I embraced her. The fellow replied that his horses were in the stable, and that he was not going to put them in; but that I could have post horses if I liked. \" It is my belief that, if I had liked, Betty would have given me everything at that moment, for she let herself fall into my arms. I pressed her tenderly and kissed her, and that was all She seemed grateful for my self–restraint. The horses were put in, and after I had paid the landlord for the supper, which he swore he had prepared for us, we started. We reached Acquapendente in three quarters of an hour, and we found the madcap count in high spirits. He embraced his Dulcinea with transports, and Betty seemed delighted to find him safe and sound.',\n",
       " 'He told us triumphantly that he had beaten the rascally postillions, and had warded their stones off. \"He is drinking to my health with his comrade; they have both begged my pardon. \" \"Yes,\" said Betty, \"this gentleman gave him a crown. \" \"What a pity! You shouldn\\'t have given them anything. \" Before supper the Comte de l\\'Etoile skewed us the bruises on his thighs and side; the rascal was a fine well–made fellow. However, Betty\\'s adoring airs irritated me, though I was consoled at the thought of the earnest I had received from her. Next day, the impudent fellow told me that he would order us a good supper at Viterbo, and that of course I would lend him a sequin to pay for his dinner at Montefiascone. So saying, he skewed me in an off–hand way a bill of exchange on Rome for three thousand crowns. I did not trouble to read it, and gave him the sequin, though I felt sure I should never see it again. Betty now treated me quite confidentially, and I felt I might ask her almost any questions.',\n",
       " 'When we were at Montefiascone she said,— \"You see my lover is only without money by chance; he has a bill of exchange for a large amount. \" \"Not at all; I only wish I were mistaken, but I am sure of the contrary. Twenty years ago I should have taken it for a good one, but now it\\'s another thing, and if the bill is a good one, why did he not negotiate it at Sienna, Florence, or Leghorn?\" \"It may be that he had not the time; he was in such a hurry to be gone. Ah! if you knew all!\" \"I only want to know what you like to tell me, but I warn you again that what I say is no vague suspicion but hard fact. \" \"Then you persist in the idea that he does not love me. \" \"Nay, he loves you, but in such a fashion as to deserve hatred in return. \" \"How do you mean?\" \"Would you not hate a man who loved you only to traffic in your charms?\" \"I should be sorry for you to think that of him. \" \"If you like, I will convince you of what I say this evening.',\n",
       " '\" \"You will oblige me; but I must have some positive proof. It would be a sore pain to me, but also a true service. \" \"And when you are convinced, will you cease to love him?\" \"Certainly; if you prove him to be dishonest, my love will vanish away. \" \"You are mistaken; you will still love him, even when you have had proof positive of his wickedness. He has evidently fascinated you in a deadly manner, or you would see his character in its true light before this. \" \"All this may be true; but do you give me your proofs, and leave to me the care of shewing that I despise him. \" \"I will prove my assertions this evening; but tell me how long you have known him?\" \"About a month; but we have only been together for five days. \" \"And before that time you never accorded him any favours?\" \"Not a single kiss. He was always under my windows, and I had reason to believe that he loved me fondly.',\n",
       " '\" \"Oh, yes! he loves you, who would not? but his love is not that of a man of honour, but that of an impudent profligate. \" \"But how can you suspect a man of whom you know nothing?\" \"Would that I did not know him! I feel sure that not being able to visit you, he made you visit him, and then persuaded you to fly with him. \" \"And who is to answer for his constancy?\" \"His love is my surety. \" \"Did he take you from a father, a lover, or a brother?\" \"From a lover, who will not be back at Leghorn for a week or ten days. \" \"Where has he gone?\" \"To London on business; I was under the charge of a woman whom he trusted. Tell me if you love your Englishman, and if he is worthy of your love. \" \"Alas! I loved him dearly till I saw this Frenchman, who made me unfaithful to a man I adored. He will be in despair at not finding me when he returns. \" \"Is he rich?\" \"Not very; he is a business man, and is comfortably off. He is a man of your age, and a thoroughly kind and honest person.',\n",
       " 'He was waiting for his consumptive wife to die to marry me. \" \"Poor man! Have you presented him with a child?\" \"No. I am sure God did not mean me for him, for the count has conquered me completely. \" \"Everyone whom love leads astray says the same thing. \" \"Now you have heard everything, and I am glad I told you, for I am sure you are my friend. \" \"I will be a better friend to you, dear Betty, in the future than in the past. You will need my services, and I promise not to abandon you.

I sent it off the day before my escape, and the man who received it was sent by the count.',\n",
       " '\" \"Then good–bye to your trunk!\" \"Why, you foresee nothing but misfortune!\" \"Well, dear Betty, I only wish my prophecies may not be accomplished. Although you escaped on horseback I think you should have brought a cloak and a carpet bag with some linen. \" \"All that is in the small trunk; I shall have it taken into my room tonight. \" We reached Viterbo at seven o\\'clock, and found the count very cheerful. In accordance with the plot I had laid against the count, I began by shewing myself demonstratively fond of Betty, envying the fortunate lover, praising his heroic behaviour in leaving her to me, and so forth. The silly fellow proceeded to back me up in my extravagant admiration. He boasted that jealousy was utterly foreign to his character, and maintained that the true lover would accustom himself to see his mistress inspire desires in other men.',\n",
       " 'He proceeded to make a long dissertation on this theme, and I let him go on, for I was waiting till after supper to come to the conclusive point. During the meal I made him drink, and applauded his freedom from vulgar prejudices. At dessert he enlarged on the duty of reciprocity between lovers. \"Thus,\" he remarked, \"Betty ought to procure me the enjoyment of Fanny, if she has reason to think I have taken a fancy to her; and per contra, as I adore Betty, if I found that she loved you I should procure her the pleasure of sleeping with you. \" Betty listened to all this nonsense in silent astonishment. \"I confess, my dear count,\" I replied, \"that, theoretically speaking, your system strikes me as sublime, and calculated to bring about the return of the Golden Age; but I am afraid it would prove absurd in practice. No doubt you are a man of courage, but I am sure you would never let your mistress be enjoyed by another man.',\n",
       " 'I will wager that amount that you will not allow me to sleep with your wife. I\\'ll bet fifty sequins that I will remain in the room a calm spectator of your exploits. My dear Betty, we must punish this sceptic; go to bed with him. \" \"Not at all; to bed with you, I shall love you all the more. \" \"You must be crazy, I shall do nothing of the kind. \" The count took her in his arms, and caressing her in the tenderest manner begged her to do him this favour, not so much for the twenty–five Louis, as to convince me that he was above vulgar prejudices. His caresses became rather free, but Betty repulsed him gently though firmly, saying that she would never consent, and that he had already won the bet, which was the case; in fine the poor girl besought him to kill her rather than oblige her to do a deed which she thought infamous. Her words, and the pathetic voice with which they were uttered, should have shamed him, but they only put him into a furious rage.',\n",
       " \"He repulsed her, calling her the vilest names, and finally telling her that she was a hypocrite, and he felt certain she had already granted me all a worthless girl could grant. Betty grew pale as death, and furious in my turn, I ran for my sword. I should probably have run him through, if the infamous scoundrel had not fled into the next room, where he locked himself in. I was in despair at seeing Betty's distress, of which I had been the innocent cause, and I did my best to soothe her. Her breath came with difficulty, her eyes seemed ready to start out of her head, her lips were bloodless and trembling, and her teeth shut tight together. I could not call for help, and all I could do was to dash water in her face, and speak soothing words. At last she fell asleep, and I remained beside her for more than two hours, attentive to her least movements, and hoping that she would awake strengthened and refreshed. At day–break I heard l'Etoile going off, and I was glad of it.\",\n",
       " 'The people of the inn knocked at our door, and then Betty awoke. \"Are you ready to go, my dear Betty?\" \"I am much better, but I should so like a cup of tea. \" The Italians cannot make tea, so I took what she gave me, and went to prepare it myself. When I came back I found her inhaling the fresh morning air at the window. She drank a few cups of tea (of which beverage the English are very fond), and soon regained her good looks. She heard some people in the room where we had supped, and asked me if I had taken up the purse which I had placed on the table. I found my purse and a piece of paper bearing the words, \"bill of exchange for three thousand crowns. \" The impostor had taken it out of his pocket in making his bet, and had forgotten it. It was dated at Bordeaux, drawn on a wine merchant at Paris to l\\'Etoile\\'s order. I took it to Betty, who told me she knew nothing about bills, and begged me to say nothing more about that infamous fellow.',\n",
       " 'She then said, in a voice of which I can give no idea,— \"For pity\\'s sake do not abandon a poor girl, more worthy of compassion than blame!\" I promised her again to have all a father\\'s care for her, and soon after we proceeded on our journey. The poor girl fell asleep, and I followed her example. We were awoke by the vetturino who informed us, greatly to our astonishment, that we were at Monterosi. We had slept for six hours, and had done eighteen miles. We had to stay at Monterosi till four o\\'clock, and we were glad of it, for we needed time for reflection. In the first place I asked about the wretched deceiver, and was told that he had made a slight meal, paid for it, and said he was going to spend the night at La Storta. We made a good dinner, and Betty plucking up a spirit said we must consider the case of her infamous betrayer, but for the last time. \"Be a father to me,\" said she; \"do not advise but command; you may reckon on my obedience.',\n",
       " 'I have no need to give you any further particulars, for you have guessed all except the horror with which the thought of my betrayer now inspires me. If it had not been for you, he would have plunged me into an abyss of shame and misery. \" \"Can you reckon on the Englishman forgiving you?\" \"I think so. Are you strong enough to follow this counsel? I warn you that if you approve of it, it must be put into execution at once. Young, pretty, and virtuous as you are, you need not imagine that I shall allow you to go by yourself, or in the company of strangers. If you think I love you, and find me worthy of your esteem, that is sufficient regard for me. I will live with you like a father, if you are not in a position to give me marks of a more ardent affection. Be sure I will keep faith with you, for I want to redeem your opinion of men, and to shew you that there are men as honourable as your seducer was vile.',\n",
       " '\" Betty remained for a quarter of an hour in profound silence, her head resting on her elbows, and her eyes fixed on mine. She did not seem either angry or astonished, but as far as I could judge was lost in thought. I was glad to see her reflective, for thus she would be able to give me a decided answer: At last she said: \"You need not think, my dear friend, that my silence proceeds from irresolution. If my mind were not made up already I should despise myself. I am wise enough at any rate to appreciate the wisdom of your generous counsels. I thank Providence that I have fallen into the hands of such a man who will treat me as if I were his daughter. \" \"Then we will go back to Leghorn, and start immediately. \" \"My only doubt is how to manage my reconciliation with Sir B― M―. I have no doubt he will pardon me eventually; but though he is tender and good–hearted he is delicate where a point of honour is concerned, and Subject to sudden fits of violence.',\n",
       " 'This is what I want to avoid; for he might possibly kill me, and then I should be the cause of his ruin. \" \"You must consider it on the way, and tell me any plans you may think of. \" \"He is an intelligent man, and it would be hopeless to endeavour to dupe him by a lie. I must make a full confession in writing without hiding a single circumstance; for if he thought he was being duped his fury would be terrible. If you will write to him you must not say that you think me worthy of forgiveness; you must tell him the facts and leave him to judge for himself. He will be convinced of my repentance when he reads the letter I shall bedew with my tears, but he must not know of my whereabouts till he has promised to forgive me. He is a slave to his word of honour, and we shall live together all our days without my ever hearing of this slip. \" \"You must not be offended if I ask you whether you have ever given him like cause for complaint before.',\n",
       " '\" \"What is his history?\" \"He lived very unhappily with his first wife; and he was divorced from his second wife for sufficient reasons. Two years ago he came to our school with Nancy\\'s father, and made my acquaintance. My father died, his creditors seized everything, and I had to leave the school, much to Nancy\\'s distress and that of the other pupils. At this period Sir B― M― took charge of me, and gave me a sum which placed me beyond the reach of, want for the rest of my days. I was grateful, and begged him to take me with him when he told me he was leaving England. He was astonished; and, like a man of honour, said he loved me too well to flatter himself that we could travel together without his entertaining more ardent feelings for me than those of a father. He thought it out of the question for me to love him, save as a daughter. \"This declaration, as you may imagine, paved the way for a full agreement.',\n",
       " '\" \"\\'However you love me,\\' I said, \\'I shall be well pleased, and if I can do anything for you I shall be all the happier. \\' \"He then gave me of his own free will a written promise to marry me on the death of his wife. We started on our travels, and till my late unhappy connection I never gave him the slightest cause for complaint. \" \"Dry your eyes, dear Betty, he is sure to forgive you. I have friends at Leghorn, and no one shall find out that we have made acquaintance. I will put you in good hands, and I shall not leave the town till I hear you are back with Sir B― M―. If he prove inexorable I promise never to abandon you, and to take you back to England if you like. \" \"But how can you spare the time?\" \"I will tell you the truth, my dear Betty. I have nothing particular to do at Rome, or anywhere else. \" \"How can I shew my gratitude to you?\" I summoned the vetturino, and told him we must return to Viterbo.',\n",
       " \"He objected, but I convinced him with a couple of piastres, and by agreeing to use the post horses and to spare his own animals. We got to Viterbo by seven o'clock, and asked anxiously if no one had found a pocket–book which I pretended I had lost. I was told no such thing had been found, so I ordered supper with calmness, although bewailing my loss. I told Betty that I acted in this sort to obviate any difficulties which the vetturino might make about taking us back to Sienna, as he might feel it his duty to place her in the hands of her supposed husband. I had up the small trunk, and after we had forced the lock Betty took out her cloak and the few effects she had in it, and we then inspected the adventurer's properties, most likely all he possessed in the world.\",\n",
       " 'A few tattered shirts, two or three pairs of mended silk stockings, a pair of breeches, a hare\\'s foot, a pot of grease, and a score of little books–plays or comic operas, and lastly a packet of letters; such were the contents of the trunk. We proceeded to read the letters, and the first thing we noted was the address: \"To M. L\\'Etoile, Actor, at Marseilles, Bordeaux, Bayonne, Montpellier, etc. She saw herself the dupe of a vile actor, and her indignation and shame were great. \"We will read it all to–morrow,\" said I; \"to–day we have something else to do. We got over our supper hastily, and then Betty begged me to leave her alone for a few moments for her to change her linen and go to bed. \"If you like,\" said I, \"I will have a bed made up for me in the next room.',\n",
       " '\" \"No, dear friend, ought I not to love your society? What would have become of me without you?\" I went out for a few minutes, and when I returned and came to her bedside to wish her good night, she gave me such a warm embrace that I knew my hour was come. I was happy, and I had reason to believe that Betty was happy also. In the morning, we had just fallen asleep, when the vettuyino knocked at the door. \"Listen,\" I said, \"it is absolutely necessary for me to recover my pocket–book, and I hope to find it at Acquapendente. \" \"Very good, sir, very good,\" said the rogue, a true Italian, \"pay me as if I had taken you to Rome, and a sequin a day for the future, and if you like, I will take you to England on those terms. \" The vetturino was evidently what is called wide awake. At seven o\\'clock we stopped at Montefiascone to write to Sir B― M―, she in English, and I in French. Betty had now an air of satisfaction and assurance which I found charming.',\n",
       " 'She said she was full of hope, and seemed highly amused at the thought of the figure which the actor would cut when he arrived at Rome by himself. She hoped that we should come across the man in charge of her trunk, and that we should have no difficulty in getting it back. \" \"I expect not, but if he does I will give him a warm welcome. If he does not take himself off I will blow out his brains. \"Not even the reward you gave me?\" \"Oh, yes! That is a little secret between ourselves. \" In less than three hours the letters were composed and written. Betty was satisfied with my letter; and her own, which she translated for my benefit, was a perfect masterpiece of sensibility, which seemed to me certain of success. I thought of posting from Sienna, to ensure her being in a place of safety before the arrival of her lover.',\n",
       " \"The only thing that troubled me was the bill of exchange left behind by l'Etoile, for whether it were true or false, I felt bound to deal with it in some way, but I could not see how it was to be done. We set out again after dinner in spite of the heat, and arrived at Acquapendente in the evening and spent the night in the delights of mutual love. As I was getting up in the morning I saw a carriage in front of the inn, just starting for Rome. I imagined that amidst the baggage Betty's trunk might be discovered, and I told her to get up, and see if it were there. We went down, and Betty recognized the trunk she had confided to her seducer. We begged the vetturino to restore it to us, but he was inflexible; and as he was in the right we had to submit. The only thing he could do was to have an embargo laid on the trunk at Rome, the said embargo to last for a month. A notary was called, and our claim properly drawn up.\",\n",
       " 'The vetturino, who seemed an honest and intelligent fellow, assured us he had received nothing else belonging to the Comte de l\\'Etoile, so we were assured that the actor was a mere beggar on the lookout for pickings, and that the rags in the small trunk were all his possessions. After this business had been dispatched Betty brightened up amazingly. My mistake will serve as a warning to me for the future, for the lesson has been a severe one, and might have been much worse if I had not had the good fortune of meeting you. \" \"I congratulate you,\" I replied, \"on having cured yourself so quickly of a passion that had deprived you of your reason. I shudder when I think of the monster; but I verily believe that I should not have regained my senses if he had not called me a hypocrite, and said that he was certain I had already granted you my favours. These infamous words opened my eyes, and made me see my shame.',\n",
       " 'I believe I would have helped you to pierce him to the heart if the coward had not run away. But I am glad he did run away, not for his sake but for ours, for we should have been in an unpleasant position if he had been killed. \" \"You are right; he escaped my sword because he is destined for the rope. \" \"Let him look to that himself, but I am sure he will never dare to shew his face before you or me again. \" We reached Radicofani at ten o\\'clock, and proceeded to write postscripts to our letters to Sir B― M― We were sitting at the same table, Betty opposite to the door and I close to it, so that anyone coming in could not have seen me without turning round. Betty was dressed with all decency and neatness, but I had taken off my coat on account of the suffocating heat. Nevertheless, though I was in shirt sleeves, I should not have been ashamed of my attire before the most respectable woman in Italy. All at once I heard a rapid step coming along the passage, and the door was dashed open.',\n",
       " 'A furious–looking man came in, and, seeing Betty, cried out,— \"Ah! there you are. \" I did not give him time to turn round and see me, but leapt upon him and seized him by the shoulders. If I had not done so he would have shot me dead on the spot. As I leapt upon him I had involuntarily closed the door, and as he cried, \"Let me go, traitor!\" Betty fell on her knees before him, exclaiming, \"No, no! he is my preserver. \" Sir B― M― was too mad with rage to pay any attention to her, and kept on,― \"Let me go, traitors!\" As may be imagined, I did not pay much attention to this request so long as the loaded pistol was in his hand. In our struggles he at last fell to the ground and I on top of him. The landlord and his people had heard the uproar, and were trying to get in; but as we had fallen against the door they could not do so. Betty had the presence of mind to snatch the pistol from his hand, and I then let him go, calmly observing, \"Sir, you are labouring under a delusion.',\n",
       " '\" Again Betty threw herself on her knees, begging him to calm himself, as I was her preserver not her betrayer. \"What do you mean by \\'preserver\\'?\" said B― M― Betty gave him the letter, saying,— \"Read that. \" The Englishman read the letter through without rising from the ground, and as I was certain of its effect I opened the door and told the landlord to send his people away, and to get dinner for three, as everything had been settled.',\n",

       " 'Chapter I CAPTAIN HORATIO HORNBLOWER was reading a smudgy proof which the printers had just sent round to his lodgings. “Seamen, Landsmen, and Boys, who wish to strike a Blow for Freedom and to cause the Corsican Tyrant to wish that he had never dared the Wrath of these British Isles. His Majesty’s Ship Sutherland of two decks and seventy four guns is at present commissioning at Plymouth, and a few Vacancies still exist to complete her Crew. Captain Horatio Hornblower in command has lately returned from a Cruize in the South Sea during which in command of the Frigate Lydia of thirty six guns, he engaged and sank the Spanish vessel Natividad of two decks and more than twice the force. The Officers, Petty Officers, and Men of the Lydia have all joined him in the Sutherland.',\n",
       " 'What Heart of Oak can resist this Appeal to Join this Band of Heroes and Share with them the new Glories which await them? Who will teach Monsieur Jean Crapaud that the Seas are Britannia’s where no Frog–eating Frenchman can show his Face? Who wishes for a Hatful of Golden Louis d’or for Prize money? There will be Fiddlers and Dancing every evening, and Provision at sixteen ounces to the Pound, the Best of Beef, the Best of Bread, and Grog at midday every Day of the Week and Sundays, all in addition to the Pay under the Warrant of His Most Gracious Majesty King George! In the Place where this notice is read can be found an Officer of His Majesty’s Ship Sutherland who will enlist any Willing Hearts who Thirst for Glory. ” Captain Hornblower struggled against hopelessness as he read the proof. Appeals of this sort were to be read in dozens in every market town.',\n",
       " 'It hardly seemed likely that he could attract recruits to a humdrum ship of the line when dashing frigate captains of twice his reputation were scouring the country and able to produce figures of prize money actually won in previous voyages. To send four lieutenants, each with half a dozen men, round the southern counties to gather recruits in accordance with this poster was going to cost him practically all the pay he had accumulated last commission, and he feared lest it should be money thrown away. The Lydia had supplied him with two hundred able–bodied seamen (his placard said nothing of the fact that they had been compulsorily transferred without a chance of setting foot on English soil after a commission of two years’ duration) but to complete his crew he needed another fifty seamen and two hundred landsmen and boys. Failure to complete his crew might mean the loss of his command, and from that would result unemployment and half–pay—eight shillings a day—for the rest of his life.',\n",
       " 'He could form no estimate at all of with how much favour he was regarded at the Admiralty, and in the absence of data it was natural to him to believe that his employment hung precariously in the balance. Anxiety and strain brought oaths to his lips as he tapped on the proof with his pencil—silly blasphemies of whose senselessness he was quite well aware even as he mouthed them. But he was careful to speak softly; Maria was resting in the bedroom through the double doors behind him, and he did not want to rouse her. Maria (although it was too early to be certain) believed herself to be pregnant, and Hornblower was sated with her cloying tenderness. His irritation increased at the thought of it; he hated the land, the necessity of recruiting, the stuffy sitting–room, the loss of the independence he had enjoyed during the months of his last commission. The printer’s messenger was waiting, hat in hand, in the hall.',\n",
       " 'To him Hornblower abruptly handed back the proof with a curt order for one gross of placards to be struck off, and then he made his way into the noisy streets. The toll keeper at the Halfpenny Gate Bridge at sight of his uniform let him through without payment; a dozen watermen at the ferry knew him as the Captain of the Sutherland and competed to catch his eye—they could expect an ample fee for rowing a Captain to his ship up the long length of the Hamoaze. Hornblower took his seat in a pair–oared wherry; it gave him some satisfaction to say no word at all as they shoved off and began the long pull through the tangle of shipping. Stroke oar shifted his quid and was about to utter some commonplace or other to his passenger, but at sight of his black brow and ill–tempered frown he thought better of it and changed his opening word to a self–conscious cough—Hornblower, acutely aware of the byplay although he had spared the man no open glance, lost some of his ill temper as a result.',\n",
       " 'He noticed the play of muscles in the brown forearms as the man strained at his oar; there was tattooing on the wrist, and a thin gold ring gleamed in the man’s left ear. He must have been a seaman before he became a waterman—Hornblower longed inexpressibly to have him haled on board when they should reach the Sutherland; if he could only lay his hands on a few dozen prime seamen his anxiety would be at an end. But the fellow of course would have a certificate of exemption, else he would never be able to ply his trade here in a part where a quarter of the British Navy came seeking for men. The victualling yard and the dockyard as they rowed past were swarming with men, too, all of them able–bodied, and half of them seamen—shipwrights and riggers—at whom Hornblower stared as longingly and as helplessly as a cat at goldfish in a bowl. The rope walk and the mast house, the sheer hulk and the smoking chimneys of the biscuit bakery went slowly by.',\n",
       " 'There was the Sutherland, riding to her moorings off Bull Point; Hornblower, as he gazed at her across the choppy water, was conscious of a queer admixture of conservative dislike in the natural pride which he felt in his new command. Her round bow looked odd at a time when every British–built ship of the line had the beak head to which his eye had long grown accustomed; her lines were ungainly and told their tale (as Hornblower noticed every time he looked at her) of more desirable qualities sacrificed for shallow draught. Everything about her—save for the lower masts which were of English origin—proved that she was Dutch–built, planned to negotiate the mud banks and shallow estuaries of the Dutch coast. The Sutherland, in fact, had once been the Dutch 74 Eendracht, captured off the Texel, and, now rearmed, the ugliest and least desirable two–decker in the Navy List.',\n",
       " 'God help him, thought Hornblower, eyeing her with a distaste accentuated by his lack of men to man her, if ever he should find himself trying to claw off a lee shore in her. She would drift off to leeward like a cocked–hat paper boat. And at the subsequent courtmartial nobody would believe a word of the evidence regarding her unweatherly qualities. “Easy!” he snapped at the wherrymen, and the oars ceased to grind in the rowlocks as the men rested; the sound of the waves slapping the sides of the boat became suddenly more apparent. As they drifted over the dancing water Hornblower continued his discontented examination. She was newly painted, but in as niggardly a fashion as the dockyard authorities could manage—the dull yellow and black was unrelieved by any white or red.',\n",
       " 'A wealthy captain and first lieutenant would have supplied the deficiency out of their own pockets, and would have shown a lick of gold leaf here and there, but Hornblower had no money to spare for gold leaf, and he knew that Bush, who kept four sisters and a mother on his pay, had none either—not even though his professional future depended in some part on the appearance of the Sutherland. Some captains would by hook or by crook have cozened more paint—gold leaf too, for that matter—out of the dockyard, as Hornblower ruefully told himself. But he was not good at cozening; not the prospect of all the gold leaf in the world could lead him to slap a dockyard clerk on the back and win his favour with flattery and false bonhomie; not that his conscience would stop him, but his self–consciousness would. He could hear the pipes twittering as preparations were made to receive him. Let ’em wait a bit longer; he was not going to be hurried today.',\n",
       " 'The Sutherland, riding high without her stores in her, was showing a wide streak of her copper. Before the wind the ugly old ship might show a pretty turn of speed. As the wind swung her across the tide she revealed her run to him. Looking over her lines, Hornblower occupied his mind with estimates of how to get the best performance out of her. Before his mind’s eye he called up a composite diagram of all the forces that would be at work on her at sea—the pressure of the wind on her sails, the rudder balancing the headsails, the lateral resistance of the keel, the friction of the skin, the impact of waves against her bows. Hornblower sketched out a preliminary trial arrangement, deciding just how (until practical tests gave him more data) he would have the masts raked and the ship trimmed. But next moment he remembered bitterly that at present he had no crew to man her, and that unless he could find one all these plans would be useless.',\n",
       " '“Give way,” he growled to the wherrymen, and they threw their weight on the oars again. “Easy, Jake,” said bow oar to stroke, looking over his shoulder. The wherry swung round under the Sutherland’s stern—trust those men to know how a boat should be laid alongside a ship of war—giving Hornblower a sight of the stern gallery which constituted to Hornblower one of the most attractive points about the ship. He was glad that the dockyard had not done away with it, as they had done in so many ships of the line. Up in that gallery he would be able to enjoy wind and sea and sun, in a privacy unattainable on deck. He could even take his exercise there, with no man’s eye upon him—the gallery was eighteen feet long, and he would only have to stoop a little under the overhanging cove. Hornblower yearned inexpressibly for the time when he would be out at sea, away from all the harassing troubles of the land, walking his stern gallery in the solitude in which alone he could relax nowadays.',\n",
       " 'Yet without a crew all this blissful prospect was withheld from him indefinitely. He felt in his pockets for silver to pay the boatmen, and although silver was woefully short his self–consciousness drove him into overpaying the men in the fashion he attributed to his fellow captains of ships of the line. Thank ’ee,” said stroke oar, knuckling his forehead. Hornblower went up the ladder and came in through the entry port with its drab paint where in the Dutchmen’s time gilding had blazed bravely. The pipes of the boatswain’s mates twittered wildly, the marine guard presented arms, the side boys stood rigidly at attention. Gray, master’s mate,—lieutenants kept no watch in harbour,—was officer of the watch and saluted as Hornblower touched his hat to the quarterdeck. Hornblower did not condescend to speak to him, although Gray was a favourite of his; the rigid guard he kept on himself for fear of unnecessary loquacity forbade.',\n",
       " 'The decks were tangled with gear as the work of rigging the ship proceeded, but the tangle, as Hornblower was careful to note, carried under its surface the framework of orderliness. The coils of rope, the groups at work on the deck, the sailmaker’s party sewing at a topsail on the forecastle, gave an impression of confusion, but it was disciplined confusion. The severe orders which he had issued to his officers had borne fruit. The crew of the Lydia, when they had heard that they were to be transferred bodily to the Sutherland without even a day on shore, had nearly mutinied. The master–at–arms was the warrant officer responsible for enforcing discipline, and was a man new to Hornblower, named Price. Hornblower concluded that he had allegations of indiscipline to lodge, and he sighed even while he set his face in an expression of merciless rigidity. Probably it would be a matter of flogging, and he hated the thought of the blood and the agony.',\n",
       " 'But, at the beginning of a commission like this, with a restive crew under his orders, he must not hesitate to flog if necessary—to have the skin and flesh stripped from the offender’s backbone. Price was coming along the gangway now at the head of the strangest procession. Two by two behind him came a column of thirty men, each one handcuffed to his neighbour, save for the last two who clanked drearily along with leg irons at their ankles. Nearly all of them were in rags, and the rags had no sort of nautical flavour about them at all. The rags of a great many of them were sacking, some had corduroy, and Hornblower, peering closer, saw that one wore the wrecks of a pair of moleskin breeches. Yet another wore the remains of what had once been a respectable black broadcloth suit—white skin showed through a rent in the shoulder. All of them had stubbly beards, black, brown, golden, and grey, and those who were not bald had great mops of tangled hair.',\n",
       " '” The procession shuffled to a halt, and the men stood sullenly on the quarterdeck. Some of them kept their eyes on the deck, while the others gaped sheepishly round them. “What the devil’s all this?” demanded Hornblower, sharply. “I signed a receipt to the sodgers what brought ’em, sir. ” “Where did they bring them from?” rasped Hornblower. “Exeter assizes, sir,” said Price, producing a list. Waites, that’s ’im in the moleskin breeches, sir, ’e was found guilty of sheepstealing. That ’un in black, ’is crime’s bigamy, sir—’e was a brewer’s manager before this ’appened to ’im. The others is larceny mostly, sir, ’cept for them two in front what’s in for rick burning and t’other two in irons. ” “Ha—h’m,” said Hornblower, wordless for the moment. The new hands blinked at him, some with hope in their eyes, some with hatred, some with indifference. They had chosen service at sea rather than the gallows, or transportation, or the gaol.',\n",
       " 'Months in prison awaiting trial accounted for their dilapidated appearance. Here was a fine addition to the ship’s company, thought Hornblower, bitterly—budding mutineers, sullen skulkers, half–witted yokels. But hands they were and he must make the most of them. His naturally humanitarian instincts dictated the course he decided to pursue after a moment’s quick thinking. “Why are they still handcuffed?” he demanded, loud enough for them all to hear. “I didn’t want to without orders, sir, seeing what they are and ’ow they come ’ere. ” “That’s nothing to do with it,” snapped Hornblower. And I’ll have no man in irons in my ship unless he’s given me cause to order it. ” Hornblower kept his gaze from wavering towards the new hands, and steadily addressed his declamation to Price—it was more effective delivered that way, he knew, even while he despised himself for using such rhetorical tricks. “I never want to see new hands in the charge of the master–at–arms again,” he continued, hotly.',\n",
       " '“They are recruits in an honourable service, with an honourable future before them. Now find one of the purser’s mates and see that each of these men is properly dressed in accordance with my orders. ” Normally it might be harmful to discipline to rate a subordinate officer in front of the men, but in the case of the master–at–arms Hornblower knew that little damage was being done. The men would come to hate the master–at–arms anyway sooner or later—his privileges of rank and pay were given him so that he might be a whipping boy for the crew’s discontent. Hornblower could drop the rasp from his voice and address the hands directly, now. “A man who does his duty as best he can,” he said, kindly, “has nothing to fear in this ship, and everything to hope for. Now I want to see how smart you can look in your new clothes, and with the dirt of the place you have come from washed off you. ” He had won over some of the poor fools, at least, he told himself.',\n",
       " 'Some of the faces which had been sullen with despair were shining with hope now, after this experience of being treated as men and not as brutes—for the first time for months, if not the first time in their lives. Poor devils; in Hornblower’s opinion they had made a bad bargain in exchanging the gaol for the navy. But at least they represented thirty out of the two hundred and fifty additional human bodies which he needed to drag at ropes and to heave at capstan bars so as to take this old Sutherland out to sea. Lieutenant Bush came hastening onto the quarterdeck, and touched his hat to his captain. The stern swarthy face with its incongruous blue eyes broke into a smile just as incongruous. It gave Hornblower a queer twinge, almost of conscience, to see the evident pleasure which Bush experienced at sight of him.',\n",
       " 'It was odd to know that he was admired—it might even be said that he was loved—by this very capable sailor, this splendid disciplinarian and fearless fighter who boasted so many of the good qualities in which Hornblower felt himself to be lacking. I was rowing guard for the middle watch and I’ve only just turned out. Where do they hail from, sir?” Hornblower told him, and Bush rubbed his hands with pleasure. I never hoped for more than a dozen from Exeter assizes. ” “We won’t get topmen from Bodmin assizes,” said Hornblower, comforted beyond measure at the equanimity with which Bush regarded the introduction of gaolbirds into the Sutherland’s crew. He was not the sort of captain—neither the distinguished kind nor the wheedling kind—who could be sure of favours from the Port Admiral. ” The lower gun deck offered a strange spectacle, lit vaguely by the light which came through half a dozen open gun ports.',\n",
       " 'Three or four were still in their hammocks, lying on their sides looking out on the others. Some were sitting in groups on the deck, chattering loud–voiced. One or two were chaffering for food through the gun ports with the occupants of shore boats floating just outside; the netting which impeded desertion had a broad enough mesh to allow a hand to pass through. Two more, each backed by a supporting group, were quarrelling violently. They were in odd contrast—one was tall and dark, so tall as to have to crouch round–shouldered under the five–foot deck beams, while the other, short, broad, and fair, was standing up boldly before her menacing advance. ” “A–ah,” screamed the dark one at this crowning insult. She swooped forward, and with greedy hands she seized the other by the hair, shaking her head from side to side as if she would soon shake it off. In return her face was scratched and her shins were kicked by her stout–hearted opponent.',\n",
       " 'They whirled round in a flurry of petticoats, when one of the women in the hammocks screamed warning to them. Every eye was turned towards Hornblower as he walked forward in the patchy light, his head bowed under the deck above. “The next woman fighting will be put ashore instantly,” growled Hornblower. The dark woman swept her hair from her eyes and sniffed with disdain. There ain’t a farden to be had out o’ this starvation ship. ” She was apparently expressing a sentiment which was shared by a good many of the women, for the speech was followed by a little buzz of approval. “Ain’t the men never goin’ to get their pay notes?” piped up the woman in the hammock. He pushed forward, anxious to save his captain from the insults to which he was exposed, thanks to a government which left its men still unpaid after a month in port. “You there, what are you doing in your hammock after eight bells?” But this attempt to assume a counter offensive met with disaster.',\n",
       " 'Lieutenant,” said she, flicking off her blanket and sliding to the deck. “I parted with my gown to buy my Tom a sausage, and my petticoat’s bought him a soop o’ West Country ale. “Get back and be decent,” spluttered Bush, on fire with embarrassment. Hornblower was laughing too—perhaps it was because he was married that the sight of a half–naked woman alarmed him not nearly as much as it did his first lieutenant. “Never will I be decent now,” said the woman, swinging her legs up into the hammock and composedly draping the blanket over herself, “until my Tom gets his pay warrant. ” “An’ when he gets it,” sneered the fair woman, “what can he do with it without shore leave? Sell it to a bumboat shark for a quarter!” “Fi’ pound for twenty three months’ pay!” added another. Hornblower beat a retreat, abandoning—forgetting, rather—the object of his visit of inspection below. He could not face those women when the question of pay came up again.',\n",
       " 'The men had been scandalously badly treated, imprisoned in the ship within sight of land, and their wives (some of them certainly were wives, although by Admiralty regulation a simple verbal declaration of the existence of a marriage was sufficient to allow them on board) had just cause of complaint. No one, not even Bush, knew that the few guineas which had been doled out among the crew represented a large part of Hornblower’s accumulated pay—all he could spare, in fact, except for the necessary money to pay his officers’ expenses when they should start on their recruiting journeys. His vivid imagination and absurd sensitiveness between them perhaps exaggerated part of the men’s hardships. The thought of the promiscuity of life below decks, where a man was allotted eighteen inches’ width in which to swing his hammock, while his wife was allowed the eighteen inches next to him, all in a long row, husbands, wives, and single men, appalled him.',\n",
       " 'So did the thought of women having to live on the revolting lower–deck food. Possibly he made insufficient allowance for the hardening effect of long habit. He emerged through the fore hatchway onto the main deck a little unexpectedly. Thompson, one of the captains of the forecastle, was dealing with the new hands. “P’raps we’ll make sailors of you,” he was saying, “and p’raps we won’t. Overside with a shot at your feet, more likely, before we sight Ushant. When the cat gets at you we’ll see the colour o’ your backbones, too, you——” “Enough of that, Thompson,” roared Hornblower, furious. In accordance with his standing orders the new hands were being treated to rid them of vermin. Naked and shivering, they were grouped about the deck.',\n",
       " 'Two of them were having their heads shorn down to the bare skin; a dozen of them, who had already submitted to this treatment (and looking strangely sickly and out of place with the prison pallor still on them), were being herded by Thompson towards the wash–deck pump which a couple of grinning hands were working. Fright was making them shiver as much as cold—not one of them, probably, had ever had a bath before, and what with that prospect, and Thompson’s blood–curdling remarks, and the strange surroundings, they were pitiful to see. It enraged Hornblower, who somehow or other had never forgotten the misery of his early days at sea. Bullying was abhorrent to him like any other sort of wanton cruelty, and he had no sympathy whatever with the aim of so many of his brother officers, to break the spirit of the men under them.',\n",
       " 'One of these days his professional reputation and his future might depend on these very men risking their lives cheerfully and willingly—sacrificing them, if need be—and he could not imagine cowed and broken–spirited men doing that. The shearing and the bath were necessary, if the ship was to be kept clear of the fleas and bugs and lice which could make life a misery on board, but he was not going to have his precious men cowed more than was unavoidable. It was curious that Hornblower, who never could believe himself to be a leader of men, would always lead rather than drive. “Under the pump with you, men,” he said, kindly, and when they still hesitated, “When we get to sea you’ll see me under that pump, every morning at seven bells. Isn’t that so, there?” “Aye aye, sir,” chorused the hands at the pump—their captain’s strange habit of having cold sea water pumped over him every morning had been a source of much discussion on board the Lydia.',\n",
       " '“So under with you, and perhaps you’ll all be captains one of these days. You, there, Waites, show these others you’re not afraid. ” It was blessed good fortune that Hornblower was able not only to remember the name, but to recognise in his new guise Waites, the sheepstealer with the moleskin breeches. They blinked at this resplendent captain in his gold lace, whose tone was cheerful and whose dignity still admitted taking a daily bath. Waites steeled himself to dive under the spouting hose, and, gasping, rotated heroically under the cold water. Someone threw him a lump of holystone with which to scrub himself, while the others jostled for their turn; the poor fools were like sheep—it was only necessary to set one moving to make all the rest eager to follow. Hornblower caught sight of a red angry welt across one white shoulder. “You’ve been free with that starter of yours, Thompson,” he said.',\n",
       " 'Thompson grinned uneasily, fingering the two–foot length of rope knotted at the end, with which petty officers were universally accustomed to stimulate the activity of the men under them. “I won’t have a petty officer in my ship,” said Hornblower, “who doesn’t know when to use a starter and when not to. These men haven’t got their wits about ’em yet, and hitting ’em won’t remedy it. Make another mistake like that, Thompson, and I’ll disrate you. And then you’ll clean out the heads of this ship every day of this commission. ” Thompson shrank away, abashed by the genuine anger which Hornblower had displayed. “Sometimes a reprimand makes a petty officer take it out of the men more than ever to pay himself back. Hornblower was the only captain he had ever heard of who bothered his head about the use of starters. Starters were as much part of Navy life as bad food and eighteen inches per hammock and peril at sea. Bush could never understand Hornblower’s disciplinary methods.',\n",
       " 'He had been positively horrified when he had heard his captain’s public admission that he too had baths under the wash–deck pump—it seemed madness for a captain to allow his men to guess that they were of the same flesh as his. But two years under Hornblower’s command had taught him that Hornblower’s strange ways sometimes attained surprising results. He was ready to obey him, loyally though blindly, resigned and yet admiring.',\n",
       " 'Chapter II “THE BOY from the Angel has brought a note, sir,” said the landlady, when Hornblower called her in in reply to her knock at the sitting–room door. ” Hornblower felt a shock as he read the address—the clear feminine handwriting which he recognised although it was months since he saw it last meant so much to him. He tried to disguise his feelings as he spoke to his wife. Rear Admiral Sir Percy and Lady Barbara Leighton would esteem it an Honour if Captain and Mrs. Horatio Hornblower would dine with them at this address Tomorrow, the Fifth, at four o’clock. He wants us to dine with him tomorrow,” said Hornblower, as casually as his beating heart would allow. “I have only my blue sack gown,” said Maria, looking up from reading it. The first thing a woman ever thought about on receiving an invitation was what she should wear.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower tried to bend his mind to the consideration of the blue sack gown, when all the time his heart was singing songs at the knowledge that Lady Barbara was only two hundred yards away. ” It would call for a far better gown to look well on Maria’s dumpy figure. But Hornblower knew that they must—they must—accept the invitation, and it would be a kindness to reassure Maria. It did not matter what clothes Maria wore as long as she thought she looked well in them. Maria smiled happily at the compliment, giving Hornblower a prick of conscience. Maria would look coarse and badly dressed and stupid beside Lady Barbara, and yet he knew that as long as he pretended to be in love with her she would be happy and unconscious. He wrote a careful acceptance, and rang the bell for it to be given to the messenger. He knew that she had been looking forward to spending the afternoon with him, and indeed he had not intended to visit the ship that day.',\n",
       " 'He could not bear the thought of being mewed up in that sitting–room with Maria and her platitudes. He wanted to be alone, to hug to himself the thought that Lady Barbara was in the same town, that he was going to see her tomorrow. He could not sit still with those thoughts bubbling within him. He could have sung for joy as he walked briskly down to the ferry, thrusting aside all remembrance of Maria’s dutiful acquiescence in his departure—well she knew how great were the demands made upon a captain by the commissioning of a ship of the line. In his yearning for solitude he urged the rowers of his boat until they sweated. On deck he gave the briefest of salutes to the quarterdeck and to the officer of the watch, before plunging below to the security and peace for which he had been yearning. There were a hundred matters to which he could have devoted his attention but he would not stay for one of them.',\n",
       " 'He strode across his cabin—littered with the preparations made for when he should come on board—and out through the stern window into the great stern gallery. There, sheltered from all interruption, he could lean against the rail, and stare across the water. The ebb was running, and with the wind light from the northeast the Sutherland’s stern gallery looked southward down the length of the Hamoaze. Before him the glittering water was studded with shipping, with shore boats rowing hither and thither. In the distance beyond the roofs of the victualling yard he could see Mount Edgecumbe—Plymouth was out of his sight, round the corner from the Devil’s Point; he would not have the satisfaction of gazing upon the roof that sheltered Lady Barbara. Still, she was there, and he would see her tomorrow. He gripped the rail in his ecstasy until his fingers hurt him.',\n",
       " 'He turned away and began to walk up and down the gallery, his hands behind his back to counterbalance the stoop necessitated by the cove above. The pain he had felt at first, three weeks back, when he had heard of Lady Barbara’s marriage to Admiral Leighton was gone by now. There was only the joy in the thought that she still remembered him. Hornblower dallied with the idea that she might have travelled down to Plymouth with her husband in the expectation of seeing him. It was possible—Hornblower would not stop to think that she might have been influenced by the desire to spend a few more days with her new husband. She must have cajoled Sir Percy into sending this invitation on the moment of his arrival; Hornblower would not make allowance for the fact that any admiral must be anxious for an early opportunity to study an unknown captain placed under his command.',\n",
       " 'She must have made Sir Percy ask at the Admiralty for his services—that would explain why they had found for him a new ship and a new command without a single month’s interval of half–pay. It was to Lady Barbara that he owed the very comforting addition of ten shillings a day to his pay which went with the command of a ship of the line. He was a quarter of the way up the captains’ list now. In less than twenty years’ time—long before he was sixty—if he continued to obtain commands in this fashion he would hoist his flag as an admiral. Then they might yellow him if they wanted to; he would be satisfied with admiral’s rank. On admiral’s half–pay he could live in London, find a patron who would nominate him to a seat in Parliament. All this was possible—and Lady Barbara still remembered him, cherished a kindly thought of him, was anxious to see him again despite the ludicrous way in which he had behaved towards her.',\n",
       " 'A seagull, wheeling motionless up wind, suddenly flapped its wings until it hovered stationary, and screamed raucously in his face. It flapped and screamed aimlessly along the gallery, and then, equally aimlessly, wheeled away again. Hornblower followed it with his eyes, and when he resumed his walk the thread of his thoughts was broken. Instantly there loomed up again into his consciousness the knowledge of the frightful need of men under which he laboured. Tomorrow he would have to confess miserably to his admiral that the Sutherland was still a hundred and fifty men short of complement; he would be found wanting in the very first of a captain’s duties. An officer might be the finest possible seaman, the most fearless fighter (and Hornblower did not think himself either), and yet his talents were useless if he could not man his ship. Probably Leighton had never asked for his services at all, and he had been allotted to Leighton’s squadron by some trick of fate.',\n",
       " 'Leighton would suspect him of having been his wife’s lover, would be consumed with jealousy, and would watch for every opportunity to achieve his ruin. He would make his life a misery to him, would plague him to madness, and would finally have him broken and dismissed the service—any admiral could break any captain if he set his mind to it. Perhaps Lady Barbara had planned to put him thus in Leighton’s power, and was working his ruin in revenge for his treatment of her. That seemed much more likely than his earlier wild imaginings, thought Hornblower, the cold fit working on him. She must have guessed just what Maria was like, and must have sent the invitation so as to have the pleasure of gloating over her weaknesses. The dinner tomorrow would be one long humiliation for him.',\n",
       " 'He could not venture to draw on his next quarter’s pay for another ten days at least; otherwise he would have taken Maria out to buy her the finest gown in Plymouth—although what would a Plymouth gown avail in the sight of an earl’s daughter who would undoubtedly buy all her clothes from Paris? He had not twenty pounds in the whole world now, having sent Bush and Gerard and Rayner and Hooker, his four lieutenants, out to drum up recruits. They had taken thirty men with them, the only trustworthy men in the whole ship, too. Probably there would be trouble on the lower deck in consequence—probably reaching a head tomorrow while he was dining with his admiral. He jerked his head up with irritation, and hit it hard against one of the beams of the cove above. Then he clenched his fists and cursed the service, as he had cursed it a thousand times before.',\n",
       " 'That made him laugh at himself—if Hornblower had never been able to laugh at himself he would have been, long ago, another of the mad captains in the Navy List. He took a firmer grip on his emotions and set himself to thinking seriously about the future. The orders which had attached him to Admiral Leighton’s squadron had stated briefly that he was destined for service in the Western Mediterranean, and it was an uncovenanted mercy on the part of the lords of the Admiralty to give him that much warning. He had known of captains who had laid in personal stores in the expectation of service in the West Indies only to find that they had been allotted to the Baltic convoy. The Western Mediterranean meant the Toulon blockade, the protection of Sicily, harassing the Genoese coasters, and, presumably, taking a hand in the war in Spain. It meant a more variegated life than the blockade of Brest, at least, although now that Spain was England’s ally there would be far less chance of prize money.',\n",
       " 'His ability to speak Spanish seemed to make it certain that the Sutherland would be employed on the coast of Catalonia in concert with the Spanish army. Lord Cochrane had distinguished himself there, but Cochrane was under a cloud now. The courtmartial which had followed the action in the Basque Roads were still echoing through the service, and Cochrane would be lucky if he ever got another ship—he was the standing example of the folly of an officer on the active list taking part in politics. Perhaps, thought Hornblower, trying to combat both optimism and pessimism simultaneously, he was intended by the Admiralty to supply Cochrane’s place. If that were the case, it meant that his professional reputation was far higher than he dared believe. Hornblower had to battle sternly with his feelings at that thought; he found himself grinning when he warned himself that excess of emotion only resulted in his hitting his head on the beams above.',\n",
       " 'That quieted him, and he began to tell himself, philosophically, that all this anticipation was merely waste of effort; he would know sooner or later anyway, and all the worrying in the world would not alter his destiny a ha’p’orth. There were a hundred and twenty British ships of the line at sea, and nearly two hundred frigates, and in every one of these three hundred and twenty ships there was a port captain, each one a god to his crew, and presumably each one a puppet to the Admiralty. He must act like a sensible man, empty his mind of all these imaginings, and go home and spend a quiet evening with his wife untroubled by thoughts of the future. Yet even as he left the stern gallery to pass the word for his gig to take him back a new wave of delirious anticipation surged through him at the thought of seeing Lady Barbara tomorrow.',\n",
       " 'Chapter III “DO I LOOK well?” asked Maria, her toilet completed. Hornblower was buttoning his full–dress coat as he stood and looked at her; he made himself smile admiringly at her. “That gown sets off your figure better than any you have ever worn. It was no use speaking the truth to Maria, telling her that that particular shade of blue revolted against the heavy red of her cheeks. With her thick figure and coarse black hair and bad complexion Maria could never appear well dressed. At best she looked like a shopkeeper’s wife; at worst like some scrub woman dressed in finery cast off by her mistress. Those stubby red hands of hers, thought Hornblower, looking at them, were very like a scrub woman’s. “I have my Paris gloves,” said Maria, noting the direction of his glance. It was the very devil, the way in which she was eager to anticipate every wish of his. It was in his power to hurt her horribly, and the knowledge made him uncomfortable.',\n",
       " 'He stood before the mirror and twitched his coat into position. “Full dress suits you well,” said Maria, admiringly. Hornblower’s first act when he had returned to England in the Lydia had been to buy himself new uniforms—there had been humiliating incidents last commission as a result of the poverty of his wardrobe. The heavy epaulettes that hung at the shoulders were of real bullion, and so was the broad gold lace round the edges and the buttonholes. Buttons and cuffs flashed as he moved; it was pleasant to see the heavy gold stripes on his cuffs that marked him as a captain with more than three years’ seniority. He approved the cut of his white Kerseymere breeches. The thick white silk stockings were the best that he could find—he remembered with a twinge of conscience as he gloated over them that Maria wore concealed under her skirt only cheap cotton stockings at four shillings a pair.',\n",
       " 'From the crown of his head to his ankles he was dressed as a gentleman should be dressed; only about his shoes was he doubtful. Their buckles were merely pinchbeck, and he feared lest their brassiness should be accentuated by contrast with the genuine gold everywhere else—funds had begun to run low when he bought them, and he had not dared spend twenty guineas on gold buckles. He must take care this evening to do nothing to call attention to his feet. It was a pity that the sword of one hundred guineas’ value voted him by the Patriotic Fund for his fight with the Natividad had not yet reached him. He still had to wear the fifty–guinea sword which had been awarded him eight years ago after the capture of the Castilla as a mere lieutenant. He took up his cocked hat—the button and lace on it were real gold, too—and his gloves. She had early learned how he hated unpunctuality, and dutifully took care never to offend in this respect.',\n",
       " 'The afternoon sunlight in the street sparkled on his gold; a militia subaltern whom they passed saluted him respectfully. Hornblower noted that the lady who hung on the subaltern’s arm looked more keenly at Maria than at him, and he thought he read in her glance the pitying amusement he expected. Maria was undoubtedly not the sort of wife one would expect to see on the arm of a distinguished officer. But she was his wife all the same, the friend of his childhood, and the self–indulgent soft–heartedness which had moved him to marry her had to be paid for now. Little Horatio and little Maria had died of the smallpox in a Southsea lodging—he owed her his devotion on account of that if for nothing else. And she thought she was carrying another child of his now. That had been madness, of course, but madness excusable in a man whose heart was torn with jealousy at the news that Lady Barbara was married.',\n",
       " 'Still, it had to be paid for in more devotion to Maria; all his decent instincts as well as his soft–heartedness and irresolution compelled him to remain faithful to her, to give her pleasure, to act as if he were her truly devoted husband. His pride would never permit him to make public acknowledgment that he had made a mistake, a silly blunder worthy of any foolish boy. On that account alone, even if he could steel himself to break Maria’s heart, he would never come to an open breach with her. Hornblower could remember the lewd comments of the Navy over Nelson’s matrimonial affairs, and there were Bowen’s and Samson’s after that. As long as he held loyally to his wife that kind of thing would never be said about him. People were tolerant of eccentricity while they laughed at weakness. They might marvel at his devotion, but that was all.',\n",
       " 'While he carried himself as if Maria was the only woman in the world for him people would be forced to assume that there was more in her constitution than was apparent to an onlooker. “It is the Angel to which we are bidden, is it not, my dear?” asked Maria, breaking in on his thoughts. ” They retraced their steps, and a jolly Devon servant maid led them through into the cool dark depths at the back of the inn. There were several persons in the oak–panelled room into which they were ushered, but for Hornblower there was only one. Lady Barbara was there in a blue silk dress, blue–grey, the exact colour of her eyes. From a gold chain round her neck hung a sapphire pendant, but the sapphires seemed lifeless compared with her glance. Hornblower made his bow, and mumbled as he presented Maria. The fringes of the room seemed to be deep in mist; only Lady Barbara could be clearly seen.',\n",
       " 'The golden sunburn which Hornblower had last seen in her cheeks had disappeared now; her complexion was as creamy white as any great lady’s should be. Hornblower became aware that someone else was speaking to him—had been speaking for some time. “A most pleasurable occasion, Captain Hornblower,” he was saying. And Captain Bolton of the Caligula, who tells me he was shipmates with you in the old Indefatigable. ” The mists were clearing a little from Hornblower’s eyes. He was able to stammer a few words, but fortunately the entrance of the innkeeper with the announcement of dinner gave him a little longer in which to collect himself. Opposite him sat Bolton, with his ruddy cheeks and open, honest face. Hornblower still felt Bolton’s grip lingering on his palm and remembered the horniness of his hand. There was nothing of the elegant world about Bolton, then. Bolton, who sat on Hornblower’s right, between him and the Admiral.',\n",
       " 'She was as plain and as dowdy as Maria herself—to Hornblower’s infinite relief. “I must congratulate you, Captain, on your appointment to the Sutherland,” said Lady Barbara on his left. A breath of perfume was wafted from her as she spoke, and Hornblower’s head swam. To smell the scent of her, and to hear her voice again, was like some romantic drug to him. “The innkeeper here,” announced the Admiral to the table at large, dipping a ladle into the silver tureen before him, “swore to me that he knew the art of turtle soup, and I entrusted a turtle to his care. The sherry wine—George, the sherry—I trust you will find tolerable. ” Hornblower incautiously took a mouthful of soup far too hot, and the pain he experienced while swallowing it helped to bring him back into reality. He turned his head to study this admiral to whom he would owe obedience for the next two or three years, who had won Lady Barbara’s hand in marriage after a courtship that could not have endured more than three weeks.',\n",
       " 'The star of the Bath and the red ribbon set off his glittering uniform. In age he could hardly be much over forty—only a year or two older than Hornblower—so that he must have attained to post rank at the earliest age family influence could contrive it. But the perceptible fullness about his jowl indicated to Hornblower’s mind either self–indulgence or stupidity; both, perhaps. So much Hornblower saw in a few seconds’ inspection. Then he forced himself to think of his manners, although between Lady Barbara and the Admiral it was hard to think clearly. “I trust you are enjoying the best of health, Lady Barbara?” he said. A quaint quarterdeck rasp of formality crept into his voice as he tried to hit the exact tone he thought the complicated situation demanded. He saw Maria, on the other side of Captain Elliott beyond Lady Barbara, raise her eyebrows a little—Maria was always sensitive to his reactions. “And you, Captain?” “I have never known Horatio better,” said Maria, interposing.',\n",
       " '“That is good news,” said Lady Barbara, turning towards her. “Poor Captain Elliott here is still shaken sometimes with the ague he acquired at Flushing. ” It was deftly done; Maria and Lady Barbara and Elliott were at once engaged in a conversation which left no room for Hornblower. He listened for a moment, and then forced himself to turn to Mrs. “Yes” and “No” were all she could say, seemingly, and the Admiral on her other side was deep in talk with Mrs. Maria and Lady Barbara continued a conversation from which Elliott soon dropped out, and which was continued across his unresisting body with a constancy which not even the arrival of the next course could interrupt. “Hornblower, perhaps you will be good enough to attend to those ducks before you. Those are neats’ tongues, Bolton, a local delicacy—as you know, of course. Will you try them, unless this beef claims your allegiance? Elliott, tempt the ladies with that ragout.',\n",
       " 'They may be partial to foreign kickshaws—made dishes are not to my taste. On the sideboard there is a cold beefsteak pie which the landlord assures me is exactly like those on which his reputation is founded, and a mutton ham such as one only finds in Devonshire. Hornblower? Barbara, my dear?” Hornblower, carving the ducks, felt a real pain in his breast at this casual use of the Christian name which was sacred to him. For a moment it impeded his neat dissection of long strips from the ducks’ breasts. With an effort he completed his task, and, as no one else at table seemed to want roast duck, he took for himself the plateful he had carved. It seemed to his heated imagination as if there was something specially pointed about the way Lady Barbara turned her shoulder to him. Perhaps Lady Barbara had decided that it was a poor compliment to her that he should have loved her, now that she had discovered the crudity of his taste from his choice of a wife.',\n",
       " 'He hoped Maria was not being too stupid and gauche—he could overhear very little of their conversation. He could eat little of the food with which the table was covered—his appetite, always finicking, had quite disappeared. He drank thirstily of the wine which was poured for him until he realised what he was doing, and checked himself; he disliked being drunk even more than overeating. Then he sat and fiddled with his food on his plate, making a pretence at eating; fortunately Mrs. Bolton beside him had a good appetite and was content to be silent while indulging it, as otherwise they would have made a dull pair. Then the table was swept clear to make room for cheese and dessert. “Pineapples not as good as we enjoyed at Panama, Captain Hornblower,” said Lady Barbara, turning back to him unexpectedly. “But perhaps you will make a trial of them?” He was almost too flustered to cut the thing with the silver knife, so much was he taken off his guard.',\n",
       " 'Now that he had her attention again he longed to talk to her, but the words would not come—or rather, seeing that what he found he wanted to ask her was whether she liked married life, while he just had enough sense not to blurt out that question, he did not have enough to substitute another for it. “Captain Elliott and Captain Bolton,” she said, “have been plying me incessantly with questions about the battle between the Lydia and the Natividad. Most of them were of too technical a nature for me to answer, especially, as I told them, since you kept me immured in the orlop where I could see nothing of the fight. ” “Her ladyship’s right,” roared Bolton, across the table—his voice was even louder than when Hornblower had known him as a young lieutenant. ” Hornblower flushed and fingered his neckcloth, conscious of every eye upon him.',\n",
       " '“Spit it out, man,” persisted Bolton; no lady’s man, and oppressed by the company, he had said hardly a word so far, but the prospect of having the battle described found his tongue for him. “The Dons put up a better fight than usual?” asked Elliott. “Well——” began Hornblower, lured into explaining the conditions in which he had fought. Everybody listened; apt questions from one or other of the men drew him on, bit by bit. Gradually the story unfolded itself, and the loquaciousness against which Hornblower was usually on his guard led him into eloquence. He told of the long duel in the lonely Pacific, the labour and slaughter and agony, up to the moment when, leaning weakly against the quarterdeck rail, he had known triumph at the sight of his beaten enemy sinking in the darkness. He stopped self–consciously there, hot with the realisation that he had been guilty of the unforgivable sin of boasting of his own achievements.',\n",
       " 'He looked round the table from face to face, expecting to read in them awkwardness or downright disapproval, pity or contempt. It was with amazement that instead he saw expressions which he could only consider admiring. Bolton, over there, who was at least five years his senior as a captain and ten in age, was eyeing him with something like hero worship. Elliott, who had commanded a ship of the line under Nelson, was nodding his massive head with intense appreciation. The admiral, when Hornblower could bring himself to steal a glance at him, was still sitting transfixed. There might possibly be a shade of regret in his dark handsome face that his lifetime in the Navy had brought him no similar opportunity for glory. But the simple heroism of Hornblower’s tale had fascinated him too; he stirred himself and met Hornblower’s gaze admiringly. “Here’s a toast for us,” he said, lifting his glass. “May the captain of the Sutherland rival the exploits of the captain of the Lydia.',\n",
       " '” The toast was drunk with a murmur of approval while Hornblower blushed and stammered. The admiration of men whose approval he valued was overwhelming; more especially as now he was beginning to realise that he had won it under false pretences. Only now was the memory returning to him of the sick fear with which he had awaited the Natividad’s broadsides, the horror of mutilation which had haunted him during the battle. He was one of the contemptible few, not like Leighton and Elliott and Bolton, who had never known fear in their lives. If he had told the whole truth, told of his emotions as well as of the mere manœuvres and incidents of the fight, they would be sorry for him, as for a cripple, and the glory of the Lydia’s victory would evaporate. His embarrassment was relieved by Lady Barbara’s arising from the table and the other women following her example. “Do not sit too long over your wine,” said Lady Barbara, as the men stood for them.',\n",
       " '“Captain Hornblower is a whist player of renown, and there are cards waiting for us.',\n",
       " 'Chapter IV WHEN THEY walked away from the Angel through the pitch–dark street Maria clung eagerly to Hornblower’s arm. ” “I’m glad you have enjoyed yourself,” said Hornblower. He knew only too well that Maria after any party to which he accompanied her delighted in discussing the others who had been present. He shrank from the inevitable dissection of Lady Barbara which was bound to come. “She has breeding,” said Maria, inexorably, “far beyond what I was led to expect by what you had told me about her. ” Searching back in his memory Hornblower realised that he had only laid stress on her fine courage and her ability to mix with men without embarrassment. At that time it had pleased Maria to think of an earl’s daughter as a masculine hoyden; now she was just as pleased to revert to the traditional attitude, admiring her for her breeding, and being gratified at her condescension. “She is a very charming woman,” he said, cautiously falling in with Maria’s mood.',\n",
       " '“She asked me if I were going to accompany you on your approaching voyage, and I explained that with the hopes of the future which we were beginning to cherish it was inadvisable. At the last moment he was able to keep the anguish out of his voice. “She wished me joy,” said Maria, “and asked me to give you her fe–felicitations. ” It irked Hornblower inexpressibly to think of Maria discussing her pregnancy with Lady Barbara. But the thought of Lady Barbara’s knowledge was one more complexity in the whirl of thoughts in his mind, and there was no chance of straightening anything out in the course of the short walk to their lodgings. “How tight those shoes were!” She chafed her feet in the white cotton stockings as she sat in the low chair; from the candle on the dressing table her shadow danced on the opposite wall. The shadow of the bed tester lay in a grim black rectangle on the ceiling. “Hang up that best coat of yours carefully,” said Maria, beginning to take the pins out of her hair.',\n",
       " '“I’m not ready for sleep,” said Hornblower, despairingly. He felt that no price would be too great to pay at the moment to be able to slip away to the solitude of his ship. But he certainly could not do that; the hour would make such a thing odd and the full–dress uniform he wore would make it preposterous. “Not ready for sleep?” It was so like Maria to repeat his words. “How strange, after this tiring evening! Did you eat too much roast duck?” “No,” said Hornblower. It was hopeless to try to explain a too rapidly working mind to Maria, hopeless to try to escape. Any attempt to do so would only hurt her feelings, and he knew by experience he could never make himself do that. “You have only to compose yourself in bed and you will sleep,” said Maria, from her own constant experience. “We have few enough nights together left to us now, darling.',\n",
       " '” That was so; Admiral Leighton had told them that the Pluto, Caligula, and Sutherland were ordered to escort as far as the Tagus the East India convoy which was even then assembling. And that raised once more the cursed question of the shortage of men—how the devil was he to complete his crew in time? Bodmin assizes might send him a few more criminals. His lieutenants, due to return any day now, might bring in a few volunteers. But he needed fifty more topmen, and topmen could not be picked up in gaols, nor in market squares. “It is a hard service,” said Maria, thinking of the approaching separation. “Better than counters at eightpence a week,” replied Hornblower, forcing himself to speak lightly. Before their marriage Maria had taught in a school with graduated fees—readers paid fourpence, writers sixpence, and counters eightpence.',\n",
       " 'The torment I went through when Miss Wentworth found I had taught Alice Stone the multiplication table although her parents only paid fourpence! And then the ungrateful minx egged that little Hopper boy to let those mice loose in the schoolroom. But I’d suffer it all again, darling, if—if that would keep you near me. ” “Not while duty calls, my dear,” said Hornblower, diving into his nightshirt. “But I’ll be back with a bagful of guineas for prize money before two years are up. Hornblower yawned elaborately, and Maria rose to the bait thus deftly cast, just as Hornblower had been sure she would. “And you said you were not ready for sleep!” she said. “Perhaps the Admiral’s port is beginning to take effect. ” He kissed her as she sat before the dressing table, and, turning hastily away, he climbed up into the big bed. There, lying on the farthest edge, keeping rigidly still, he lay until Maria had blown out the candle and climbed up beside him, until her breathing grew quiet and regular.',\n",
       " 'Only then could he relax and change position and give rein to the galloping thoughts coursing through his mind. He remembered what Bolton had said to him with a wink and a nod when they had found themselves together at one time during the evening in a corner where they could not be overheard. “He means six votes to the Government,” said Bolton, jerking his head towards the Admiral. Bolton was as stupid as a good seaman could be, but he had been in London recently and attended a levee and had heard the gossip. The poor old King was going mad again, a Regency was imminent, and with the Regency the Tories might go out and the Whigs might come in—the six votes of the Leighton interests were valuable.',\n",
       " 'With the Marquis Wellesley as Foreign Secretary, and Henry Wellesley as Ambassador in Spain, and Sir Arthur Wellesley—what was his new title? Lord Wellington of course—as Commander in Chief in the Peninsula it was not surprising to find Lady Barbara Wellesley married to Sir Percy Leighton, and still less to find the latter given a command in the Mediterranean. The virulence of the Opposition was growing day by day, and the history of the world hung in the balance. Hornblower shifted restlessly in bed at the thought, but a slight movement by Maria in reply fixed him rigid again. It was only a small party of men—the Wellesleys chief among them—who still had the resolution to continue the struggle against the Corsican’s dominion. The smallest check, on land, at sea, or in Parliament, might pull them from their high positions, bring their heads perilously near the block, and tumble all Europe into ruin.',\n",
       " 'Sometime during the evening Lady Barbara had been pouring tea, and Hornblower had found himself standing alone beside her, waiting for his refilled cup. “It gave me pleasure,” she had murmured, “when my husband told me you had been given the Sutherland. Probably she was hinting at the necessity for maintaining Leighton in his command. It had been no indication, all the same, that she had exerted herself to obtain the appointment for Hornblower. But it was satisfactory to be able to think that she had married Sir Percy for some other reason than love. Hornblower hated the thought of Lady Barbara being in love with anyone. He began to remember every word she had said to her husband, every look she had given him. Certainly she did not seem in the least like an adoring bride. But the fact remained that she was Leighton’s wife—that she was in bed with him at this very minute.',\n",
       " 'He told himself very sensibly that only misery and madness lay before him if he allowed himself to think about that, and, grasping resolutely at the tail of the first train of thought which recurred to him, he began to analyse the whist he had been playing. If he had not taken that unsuccessful finesse against that lead of Elliott’s he would have saved the rubber. His play had been correct—the chances were three to two—but a gambler would not have stopped to consider that. He would have gone baldheaded for results and in this case would have achieved them. But only a gambler could risk a king being unguarded. He prided himself on the precision and science of his play. Nevertheless, he was two guineas the poorer as a result of this evening, and the loss of two guineas was a devilish serious matter at present. He wanted to buy a litter of pigs and two dozen fowls—a couple of sheep as well, for that matter—before weighing anchor in the Sutherland.',\n",
       " 'Some he could buy later and more advantageously in the Mediterranean, but it would be well to have five or six dozen on board at the start. The effect on the officers and men might be bad for discipline if he were not provided with every luxury as a captain should be; and if the voyage out were long and lazy he would have to entertain his brother captains—the Admiral, too, most likely—and they would look at him askance if he offered them the ship’s fare on which he was content to live. The list of things he needed stretched longer and longer in his imagination. Four more pairs of silk stockings if there was to be much shore–going formality, as seemed likely. All these things were necessary to his dignity as captain—and to his own pride, for he hated the idea of people thinking him poor. He could spend all the next quarter’s pay on these things and still not have bought too much.',\n",
       " 'Maria would feel the pinch during the next three months, but Maria, fortunately, was used to poverty and to staving off creditors. It was hard on Maria, but if ever he became an admiral he would repay her loyalty with luxury. There were books which he wanted to buy as well; not for entertainment—he had a chest of books, including Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire for bedside reading, all old friends—but to fit him for the coming campaign. In the Morning Chronicle yesterday there had been a notice of An Account of the Present War in Spain which he would like to have, and there were half a dozen others. The more he knew about the peninsula on whose coast he was going to fight, and of the leaders of the nation he was to help, the better. But books cost money, and he did not know where to turn for money. He rolled over again and thought of the ill fortune which had always dogged him in the matter of prize money.',\n",
       " 'The Admiralty had refused to pay out a penny on account of the sunk Natividad. Since the capture of the Castilla when he was a young lieutenant he had never had a windfall, while frigate captains whom he knew had made thousands of pounds. It was maddening—especially as in his present poverty–stricken condition he was hampered in his exertions to complete the Sutherland’s crew. That shortage of men was the most harassing of all his worries—that and the thought of Lady Barbara in Leighton’s arms. Hornblower’s thoughts had gone full circle now, and were starting all over again. There was plenty to keep him restless and wakeful all through the weary night, until the dawn began to creep through the curtains; fantastic theories about Lady Barbara’s state of mind, and hard–headed plans for making the Sutherland efficient for sea.',\n",
       " 'Chapter V CAPTAIN HORNBLOWER was walking up and down his quarterdeck amid all the last–minute bustle of getting ready for sea. He was raging to himself at the length of time necessary for these final preparations, although he knew quite well that every factor causing delay was susceptible to a reasonable explanation. Two thirds of the men scurrying about the decks, urged on by the cane of Harrison the boatswain and the rope’s ends of the petty officers, were landsmen most of whom until lately had never seen the sea, let alone been in a ship. The simplest order left them merely bewildered, and they had to be led to their tasks and the ropes actually put into their hands; even then they were far more inefficient than trained seamen, because they had not learned the knack of throwing all their weight simultaneously on the rope and walking away with it. And having once set them heaving, it was hard for a petty officer to remember that a shout of “Avast” or “Belay” meant nothing to them.',\n",
       " 'More than once the few trained seamen among them, obeying promptly, were thrown off their feet and trampled upon by the rush of landsmen still heaving away. On one occasion of this sort a water butt while being hove up by a whip to the main yard–arm had simply gone away with a run again, and only the mercy of Providence had saved it from going clean through the bottom of the longboat overside. It was owing to Hornblower’s own orders that the water was so late in being brought aboard. Water left months in cask became so foul and so crawling with living things that he had put off bringing it aboard until the last possible moment. That twelve tons of biscuit had also been delayed was the result of the usual incompetence of the victualling yard, whose officials seemed incapable of reading or writing or figuring.',\n",
       " 'The complication due to the fact that a shore boat with captain’s stores was having to be unloaded at the same time, and its precious cargo passed carefully down the after hatchway, was due to the Patriotic Fund’s delay in sending down to him the sword value one hundred guineas which he had been awarded for his fight with the Natividad. No shopkeeper or ship chandler would give credit to a captain about to sail on a new commission. The sword had only arrived yesterday, barely in time for him to pledge it with Duddingstone the chandler, and Duddingstone had only grudgingly given him credit on it, forcing him to promise faithfully to redeem it at the earliest opportunity. “A sight too much writing on this for me,” said Duddingstone, pointing with a stubby forefinger at the wordy legend which the Patriotic Fund had had engraved, at vast expense, upon the blue steel of the blade. Only the gold on hilt and scabbard and the seed pearls on the pommel had any intrinsic value.',\n",
       " 'Duddingstone, to give him his due, had been quite right in saying that it was hardly worth forty guineas’ credit at his shop, even allowing for his profit and the chance of its being redeemed. But he had kept his word and had sent off the stores at dawn next morning—one more complication in the business of preparing for sea. Along the gangway Wood the purser was dancing with rage and anxiety. “God damn and blast all you ham–fisted yokels!” he was saying. Take that grin off your face and be more careful, or I’ll have you clapped under hatches to sail with us today. Easy, there, easy! Christ, rum at seven guineas an anker isn’t meant to be dropped like pig iron!” Wood was supervising the loading of the rum. The old hands were doing their best to make sure that the clumsiness of the new ones would result in the staving of a keg or two, so as to swill from the leaks, and the grinning lightermen overside were abetting them.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower could see by the red faces and uncontrollable hilarity that some of the men had succeeded in getting at the spirits, despite Wood’s eagle eye and the marine sentries on guard; but he had no intention of interfering. It would merely compromise his dignity to try to keep sailors from stealing rum if they had the barest opportunity—no one had ever yet succeeded in that task. From his position of vantage beside the quarterdeck rail he looked down upon a curious bit of byplay on the main deck. A bewildered young giant—a tin miner, Hornblower guessed, from his biceps—had rounded upon Harrison, apparently driven frantic by the volley of orders and blasphemy hurled at him. But Harrison at forty five had fought his way up to boatswain’s rank through hundreds of such encounters, and in his prime might have contested for the highest honours of the prize ring. He slipped the Cornishman’s clumsy punch and felled him with a crashing blow on the jaw.',\n",
       " 'Then without ceremony he seized him by the scruff of the neck and kicked him across the deck to the tackle which was waiting. Dazed, the Cornishman took hold with the others and heaved with them, while Hornblower nodded approvingly. The Cornishman had made himself liable to “death, or such less penalty,” as the Articles of War said, by raising his hand to his superior officer. But it was not the moment to invoke the Articles of War, even though they had been read over to the Cornishman last night on his compulsory enlistment. Gerard had sailed round with the longboat and had raided Redruth and Camborne and St. Ives, taking each place by surprise and returning with fifty stout Cornishmen who could hardly be expected yet to appreciate the administrative machinery of the service which they had joined.',\n",
       " 'In a month’s time, perhaps, when everyone on board would have learnt the heinousness of such an offence, a courtmartial might be needed and a flogging—death, perhaps—but at the present time it was best to do what Harrison had just done, and crack the man on the jaw and set him to work again. Hornblower found time to thank God he was a captain and out of the hurly–burly, for any attempt on his part at cracking men on the jaw would be a lamentable failure, he knew. He shifted his weight from one leg to the other, and was reminded of the fact that he was horribly tired. Night after night now he had not slept, and his days had been spent in all the numerous activities necessitated by commissioning a ship of the line. The nervous tension induced by his worrying about Lady Barbara and Maria, by money troubles and manning troubles, had prevented him from leaving the details to Bush and Gerard even though he knew they were perfectly capable of dealing with everything.',\n",
       " 'Worry and anxiety would not allow him to rest, and had goaded him into activity. Day after day he had longed for the moment when he should get to sea, and could settle down into the comfortable solitude which surrounds a ship’s captain, leaving all his shore worries behind him, even leaving Lady Barbara behind him. He had the sense to realise that this new meeting with her had thoroughly upset him. He had given up as insoluble the problem of whether or not she had secured his nomination to the Sutherland; he had tried his hardest to combat his consuming jealousy of her husband. He had persuaded himself in the end that what he wanted more than anything else was to escape from her, just as he wanted to escape from Maria’s cloying sweetness and lovable stupidity, from all the complex misery of life on land. He had yearned for the sea as a castaway yearns for a drink of water.',\n",
       " 'Two days ago the prospect of thus standing on the deck in the final bustle of departure seemed marvellously desirable to him. Now, he realised with a gulp, he was not quite so sure. It was like having a limb torn out by the roots to be leaving Lady Barbara like this. And, oddly enough, he was distressed at leaving Maria, too. There would be a child born before he could be home again, a child well over a year old, running about, perhaps even saying its first few words. Maria would have to go through her pregnancy and confinement without his moral support; and he knew, despite the brave way in which she had dismissed the subject, and despite her stout–hearted good–bye, how much she would miss him. With all her courage her lips had trembled and her eyes had been wet when she lifted her face to him, in the sitting–room of their lodgings; they had agreed long ago that it was foolish to prolong the pangs of parting by her accompanying him on board.',\n",
       " 'Even then the urge to be off had still been strong enough to take him from her arms without a pang, but it was different now. Hornblower mentally spurned himself as a sentimental fool, and glanced impatiently up at the masthead vane. If it should come round to north or nor’east the admiral would be anxious to start. The convoy, and the Pluto and Caligula, were assembled now, or pretty nearly, in Cawsand Bay; if the admiral decided not to wait for the stragglers he would be irritated at the Sutherland’s delay, be it never so unavoidable. That patience in his voice irritated Hornblower further. It implied a slight rebuke, a rebuke only apparent to Bush and Hornblower. Hornblower knew that Bush was working as hard as he could, and that he was working the men as hard as he could, too. Hornblower’s order had been a mere manifestation of impatience, and Bush knew it.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower was annoyed with himself for having so unguardedly broken his rule of never saying an unnecessary word to his officers, and by way of advancing a reason for having spoken he went down below to his cabin, as he had not intended to do. The sentry stood aside for him as he entered the door of his sleeping cabin on the half deck. There was plenty of room here; even the presence of a twelve–pounder left ample space for his cot and his desk and his chest. Polwheal had set everything to rights here already; Hornblower passed through into the main cabin. Here there was ample room, too; the Dutchmen who designed the Sutherland had lofty ideas regarding the comfort of the captain. The cabin extended across the whole width of the stern, and the great stern windows gave plenty of light. The stone–coloured paint made the cabin sunny and cheerful, and the black bulks of a twelve–pounder on each side made an effective colour scheme.',\n",
       " 'A couple of hands were standing by Polwheal in here while he lay on his stomach packing away cases of wine into the lockers. Hornblower glared at them, realising that he could not yet retire to the solitude of the stern gallery while he should be under their observation through the stern windows. He went back to the sleeping gallery and threw himself with a sigh on his cot, but his restlessness brought him to his feet again and across to his desk. He took out a crackling document and sat down to look through it again. Orders to the Inshore Squadron, Western Mediterranean, by Sir Percy Gilbert Leighton, K. There was nothing unusual about them at all—night signals, private signals, British, Spanish and Portuguese; rendezvous in case of separation; a line or two regarding the tactics to be adopted in the event of encountering while with the convoy a hostile squadron of any force.',\n",
       " 'The flagship would accompany the Lisbon convoy of transports into the Tagus—calling for orders, presumably; the Caligula was to take the storeships Harriet and Nancy to Port Mahon; the Sutherland was to escort the East Indiamen as far as Latitude 35° before heading for the Straits, to the final rendezvous off Palamos Point. Captains of His Britannic Majesty’s ships were informed that the coast of Andalusia, with the exception of Cadiz and Tarifa, was in the hands of the French, and so also was the coast of Catalonia from the frontier to Tarragona. At the same time captains entering any Spanish port whatever must take the most careful precautions lest the French should be in occupation there. The attached schedule of instructions to masters of ships in the convoy was mostly repetition of all this. But to Hornblower, musing over these orders, they told a very full and complicated story.',\n",
       " 'They told how, although Trafalgar had been fought five years back, and although England was maintaining at sea the greatest fleet the world had ever seen, she was still having to strain every nerve in the struggle. The Corsican was still building fleets in nearly every port in Europe, Hamburg, Antwerp, Brest, Toulon, Venice, Trieste, and a score of places in between, so that outside every port storm–beaten squadrons of English battleships had to maintain an unceasing watch—a hundred and twenty ships of the line could be found employment, if they could have been spared, on the blockade alone, without regard to the other duties. And at the same time every creek and fishing harbour along half the coasts of Europe maintained privateers, even if hardly better than big rowboats full of men, always ready to dash out and capture the helpless British merchant ships to be found in every sea.',\n",
       " 'To guard against these depredations British frigates had to maintain unceasing patrol, and no King’s ship could be despatched on any mission whatever without taking advantage of the opportunity given to convoy merchant shipping on part of their journey at least. In this war against the world only the most careful and scientific distribution of force could prevail, and now, mustering all her strength, England was taking the offensive. Her armies were on the march in Spain, and three ships of the line, scraped together from other duties from which they might just be spared, were being sent to attack the vulnerable flank which Bonaparte had incautiously exposed by his advance into the Peninsula. The Sutherland was destined to be the point of the spearhead which was making the thrust against the tyranny which dominated all Europe. Automatically he was pacing up and down again, his head bent under the deck beams, and his walk limited to four strides between the twelve–pounder and the door.',\n",
       " 'It was an honourable and responsible position, and yet he had not the men to man his ship. To make or set sail in the way it should be done in a King’s ship—or rather, with the rapidity and facility which might make the difference between defeat and victory—called for two hundred and fifty trained seamen. And if all the trained men were aloft at once there would be none at the guns. To serve the guns, if both broadsides were in action at once, called for four hundred and fifty men—two hundred of them, he admitted, might be untrained—and nearly a hundred more carrying powder and engaged upon necessary duties about the ship. He had a hundred and ninety trained men from the Lydia and a hundred and ninety raw landsmen. During the commissioning of the Sutherland only twenty old Lydias had deserted, abandoning two years’ pay and risking the penalty of a thousand lashes, and he knew he was lucky at that.',\n",
       " 'Some captains would have lost two thirds of their crews during as long a stay as this in a home port. But those twenty missing men would have been desperately useful now. He was a hundred and seventy men—a hundred and seventy trained men—short of complement. In six weeks he might drill his landsmen, all except that proportion of hopeless ones, diseased, crippled, or idiotic whom he could expect to find among them, into passable seamen and gunners. But in less than six weeks, possibly in less than three, he would be in action on the coast of Spain. By tomorrow night, even, he might be at grips with the enemy—the wind was backing towards the east and might bring out a French squadron of ships of the line from Brest, evading the blockading squadron, and crammed with men, to fall upon such a tempting prize as the East India convoy.',\n",
       " 'What chance would the Sutherland stand, yard–arm to yard–arm with a French first rate, with only two thirds of her proper crew, and half of them seasick? Hornblower clenched his fists again, boiling with exasperation at the thought. It was he who would be held responsible for any disaster, who would have to sustain the contempt or the pity—either alternative horrible to contemplate—of his brother captains. He yearned and hungered for men, more passionately than ever miser desired gold, or a lover his mistress. Ives and Redruth had been his last effort; he knew that he had been fortunate to get as many as fifty men from there. There would be no chance of obtaining any from the convoy. Government transports to Lisbon, Government storeships to Port Mahon, East India Company’s ships—he could not take a man from any of those. He went across to his desk again and took out his private duplicate of the ship’s watch bill, which he and Bush had sat up through most of the night to draw up.',\n",
       " 'It was largely upon that watch bill that the efficiency of the ship would depend in her short–handed condition; the trained men had to be distributed evenly over every strategic point, with just the right proportion of landsmen to facilitate training and yet not to impede the working of the ship. Foretop, maintop, and mizzen top; forecastle and afterguard; every man had to be assigned a duty, so that whatever evolution out of the thousand possible was being carried out, in fair weather or foul, in daylight or darkness, he would go to his position without confusion or waste of time, knowing exactly what he had to do. He had to have his place at the guns allotted him under the command of the officer of his division. It had a kind of card–castle stability—adequate enough at first sight, but incapable of standing any strain or alteration. Casualties or disease would bring the whole thing down in ruins.',\n",
       " 'He flung the watch bill down as he remembered that, if the cruise were a healthy one, he might expect one death every ten days from accident or natural causes without regard to hostile action. Fortunately it was the unseasoned men who were the more likely to die. Hornblower cocked his ear at the din on the main deck. The hoarse orders, the pipes of the boatswain’s mates, and the stamp–and–go of many feet told him that they were heaving up the longboat from overside. A strange squeaking, unlike that of the sheaves in the blocks, which had reached him for some time and which he had been unable to identify so far, he suddenly realised was the noise of the various families of pigs—captain’s stores and wardroom stores—at last come on board. He heard a sheep bleating and then a cock crowing to the accompaniment of a roar of laughter. He had brought no cock along with his hens; it must belong to someone in the wardroom or the midshipmen’s berth.',\n",
       " 'Someone thumped on the cabin door, and Hornblower snatched up his papers and dropped into his chair. Not for worlds would he be seen standing up and obviously awaiting the hour of departure with discomposure. A scared young midshipman put his head round the door—it was Longley, Gerard’s nephew, newly come to sea. Bush says the last of the stores are just coming on board, sir,” he piped. Hornblower eyed him with a stony indifference which was the only alternative to grinning at the frightened little imp. “Very good,” he growled, and busied himself with his papers. “Yes, sir,” said the boy, after a moment’s hesitation, withdrawing. The child’s face, more terrified than ever, reappeared round the door. What was it you said last?” The child’s face wrinkled into the extreme of puzzlement, and then cleared as he realised the point of the question. ” That boy had a certain amount of quickness of wit, and did not allow fright to bereave him entirely of his senses.',\n",
       " 'If he learned quickly how to handle the men he would make a useful warrant officer. Hornblower put away his papers and locked his desk; he took a few more turns up and down his cabin, and then, a sufficient interval having elapsed to conserve his dignity, he went up to the quarterdeck. Easy with those falls there, you—you——” Even Bush had reached the condition when there was no more savour in oaths. The ship was in a horrible state of muddle, the decks were filthy, the crew exhausted. Hornblower stood with his hands behind him in a careful attitude of Olympian detachment as the order was given for all hands to make sail, and the petty officers drove the crew, stupid with weariness, to their stations. Savage, the senior midshipman, whom Hornblower had seen grow from boyhood to manhood under his eye, came shouting for the afterguard to man the main topsail halliards.',\n",
       " 'Savage was wan and his eyes were bloodshot; a night of debauchery in some foul haunt in Plymouth had not left him in the best of condition. As he shouted he put his hand to his temple, where clearly the din he was making was causing him agony. Hornblower smiled to himself at the sight—the next few days would sweat him clean again. “Captain of the afterguard!” yelled Savage, his voice cracking. “I don’t see the afterguard coming aft! Quicker than that, you men! Clap on to the main topsail halliards, there! I say, you master–at–arms. D’ye hear, there!” A boatswain’s mate headed a rush to the mizzen rigging at Hornblower’s elbow. Hornblower saw young Longley standing hesitating for a second, looking up at the men preceding him, and then, with a grimace of determination, the boy leaped for the ratlines and scrambled up after them.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower appreciated the influences at work upon him—his fear of the towering height above him, and then his stoical decision that he could follow wherever the other men could venture. Bush was looking at his watch and fuming to the master. “Nine minutes already! God, look at them! The marines are more like sailors!” The marines were farther aft, at the mizzen topsail halliards. Their booted feet went clump–clump–clump on the deck. They did their work like soldiers, with soldierly rigidity, as if at drill. Sailors always laughed at that, but there was no denying that at the present moment it was the marines who were the more efficient. A roar from Harrison forward told that the mooring was slipped, and Hornblower, casting a final glance up at the wind vane, saw that the wind had backed so far easterly that rounding Devil’s Point was not going to be simple. With the yards braced round the Sutherland turned on her keel and slowly gathered way.',\n",
       " 'Women’s screeches and a fluttering of handkerchiefs from the shore boats told how some of the wives whom Hornblower had turned out twenty four hours ago had put off to say good–bye. Close overside he saw a woman in the stern sheets of a boat blubbering unashamed, her mouth wide open and the tears running like rivers. It was no more than an even chance that she would ever see her man again. “Keep your eyes inboard, there!” yelled Harrison, who had detected some member of the crew waving farewell. Every man’s attention must be kept strictly to the business in hand now. Hornblower felt the ship heel as Bush directed her course as near to the wind as she would lie; with Devil’s Point ahead, and an unfamiliar ship to handle, it was clearly as well to get as far to windward as possible. That heeling of the ship awakened a storm of memories.',\n",
       " 'It was not until one was in a ship under sail, with the deck unstable under one’s feet, and the familiar rattle of the blocks and piping of the rigging in one’s ears, that the thousand and one details of life at sea became vivid and recognisable again. Hornblower found himself swallowing hard with excitement. They were shaving the Dockyard Point as closely as possible. Most of the dockyard hands left their work to stare at them, stolidly, but not a soul among them raised a cheer. In seventeen years of warfare they had seen too many King’s ships putting out to sea to be excited about this one. Hornblower knew that he ought to have a band on board, to strike up “Britons, Strike Home,” or “Come cheer up, my lads, ’tis to glory we steer,” but he had no band; he had not the money for one, and he was not going to call on the marine fifer or the ship’s fiddler to make a tinny little noise at this moment. Stonehouse Pool was opening up before them now, and beyond it lay the roofs of Plymouth.',\n",
       " 'Maria was there somewhere; perhaps she could see the white topsails, close–hauled to the wind. Perhaps Lady Barbara was there, looking out at the Sutherland. A little flaw of wind, blowing down Stonehouse Pool, took the ship nearly aback. She staggered until the helmsman allowed her to pay off. They were coming dangerously close in to Cremyll—he had been correct in his surmise that the Sutherland would make plenty of leeway. He watched the wind, and the set of the tide off the point. He looked ahead at Devil’s Point on the starboard bow. It might be necessary at any moment to put the ship about and beat up to northward again before breasting the tide once more. At the very moment when he saw that they would weather the point he saw Bush raise his head to bark the orders to go about. Bush,” he said; the quiet order was an announcement that he had taken charge, and Bush closed the mouth which had opened to give the order.',\n",
       " 'They cleared the buoy a bare fifty yards from any danger, with the water creaming under the lee now as she lay over to the fresh breeze. Hornblower had not interfered to demonstrate the superiority of his seamanship and judgment, but merely because he could not stand by and watch something being done a little less artistically than was possible. In the cold–blooded calculation of chances he was superior to his lieutenant, as his ability at whist proved. Hornblower stood sublimely unconscious of his motives; in fact he hardly realised what he had done—he never gave a thought to his good seamanship. They were heading straight for the Devil’s Point now; Hornblower kept his eye on it as they opened up the Sound. ” With the wind abeam they headed into the Sound, the rugged Staddon Heights to port and Mount Edgecumbe to starboard. At every yard they advanced towards the open sea the wind blew fresher, calling a keener note from the rigging.',\n",
       " 'The Sutherland was feeling the sea a little now, heaving perceptibly to the waves under her bows. With the motion, the creaking of the wooden hull became audible—noticeable on deck, loud below until the ear grew indifferent to the noise. “God blast these bloody farmers!” groaned Bush, watching the way in which the topgallant sails were being set. Drake’s Island passed away to windward; the Sutherland turned her stern to it as with the wind on her port quarter she headed down the Sound. Before the topgallant sails were set they were abreast of Picklecomb Point and opening up Cawsand Bay. There was the convoy—six East Indiamen with their painted ports like men of war, all flying the gridiron flag of the Honourable Company and one sporting a broad pendant for all the world like a king’s commodore; the two naval storeships and the four transports destined for Lisbon. The three–decker Pluto and the Caligula were rolling to their anchors to seaward of them.',\n",
       " '“Flagship’s signalling, sir,” said Bush, his glass to his eye. ” The Pluto had not been in sight more than thirty seconds, but there was need for promptness in acknowledging this, the first signal made by the Admiral. “Sutherland’s pendant, sir,” said the unfortunate signal midshipman, staring through his glass. “Get those t’gallants in again and back the main topsail, Mr. ” With his telescope Hornblower could see men racing up the rigging of the ships. In five minutes both the Pluto and the Caligula had a cloud of canvas set. “They commissioned at the Nore, blast ’em,” growled Bush. At the Nore, the gateway of the busiest port in the world, ships of the Royal Navy had the best opportunity of completing their crews with prime seamen taken from incoming merchant vessels, in which it was not necessary to leave more than half a dozen hands to navigate their ships up to London river.',\n",
       " 'In addition, the Pluto and Caligula had enjoyed the advantage of having been able to drill their crews during the voyage down channel. Make all sail con–conformable with the weather, sir. ” An angry report and a puff of smoke indicated that the admiral was calling pointed attention to his signals. The Indiamen, with their heavy crews and man–o’–war routine, were already under weigh. The storeships and transports were slower, as was only to be expected. The other ships were backing and filling outside for what seemed an interminable time before the last of them came creeping out. “’Nother signal from the flagship, sir,” said Vincent, reading the flags and then hurriedly referring to the signal book. ” That would be to windward of the convoy, and, with the wind abaft as it was, in the rear. Then the ships of war could always dash down to the rescue if a Frenchman tried to cut off one of the convoy under their noses.',\n",
       " 'The flagship’s topgallants were set, and, as he looked, he saw her royals being spread as well. He would have to conform, but with the wind increasing as it was he fancied that it would not be long before they would have to come in again. He gave the order to Bush, and watched while the crew gathered at Harrison’s bellow of “All hands make sail. ” He could see the landsmen flinch, not unnaturally—the Sutherland’s main royal yard was a hundred and ninety feet above the deck and swaying in a dizzy circle now that the ship was beginning to pitch to the Channel rollers. Hornblower turned his attention to the flagship and the convoy; he could not bear the sight of frightened men being hounded up the rigging by petty officers with rope’s ends. The Navy did not—of necessity could not—admit the existence of the sentences “I cannot” and “I am afraid.',\n",
       " '” No exceptions could be made, and this was the right moment to grain it into men who had never known compulsion before that every order must be obeyed. If his officers were to start with leniency, leniency would always be expected, and leniency, in a service which might at any moment demand of a man the willing sacrifice of his life, could only be employed in a disciplined crew which had had time to acquire understanding. But Hornblower knew, and sympathised with, the sick terror of a man driven up to the masthead of a ship of the line when previously he had never been higher than the top of a haystack. “Peace’ll be signed,” grumbled Bush to Crystal, the master, “before we make sailors out of these clodhoppers. ” A good many of the clodhoppers in question had three days before been living peacefully in their cottages with never a thought of going to sea.',\n",
       " 'And here they were under a grey sky, pitching over a grey sea, with a keener breeze than ever they had known blowing round them, overhead the terrifying heights of the rigging, and underfoot the groaning timbers of a reeling ship. They were well out to sea now, with the Eddystone in sight from the deck, and under the pressure of the increased sail the Sutherland was growing lively. She met her first big roller, and heaved as it reached her bow, rolled, corkscrew fashion, as it passed under her, and then pitched dizzily as it went away astern. “Keep it off the decks!” Men were being seasick already, with the freedom of men taken completely by surprise. Hornblower saw a dozen pale forms staggering and lurching towards the lee rails. One or two men had sat down abruptly on the deck, their hands to their temples. The ship heaved and corkscrewed again, soaring up and then sinking down again as if she would never stop, and the shuddering wail from the waist was repeated.',\n",
       " 'With fixed and fascinated eyes Hornblower watched a wretched yokel vomiting into the scuppers. His stomach heaved in sympathy, and he found himself swallowing hard. There was sweat on his face although he suddenly felt bitterly cold. He wanted to be alone, to vomit in discreet privacy, away from the amused glances of the crowd on the quarterdeck. He braced himself to speak with his usual stern indifference, but his ear told him that he was only achieving an unsuccessful perkiness. ” He had lost his sea legs, too, during this stay in harbour—he reeled as he crossed the deck, and he had to cling with both hands to the rail of the companion. He reached the half deck safely and lurched to the after–cabin door, stumbling over the coaming. “Get out!” Polwheal vanished, and Hornblower reeled out into the stern gallery, fetching up against the rail, leaning his head over towards the foaming wake. He hated the indignity of seasickness as much as he hated the misery of it.',\n",
       " 'It was of no avail to tell himself, as he did, despairingly, while he clutched the rail, that Nelson was always seasick, too, at the beginning of a voyage. Nor was it any help to point out to himself the unfortunate coincidence that voyages always began when he was so tired with excitement and mental and physical exertion that he was ready to be sick anyway. It was true, but he found no comfort in it as he leaned groaning against the rail with the wind whipping round him. He was shivering with cold now as the nor’easter blew; his heavy jacket was in his sleeping cabin, but he felt he could neither face the effort of going to fetch it, nor call Polwheal to bring it. And this, he told himself with bitter irony, was the calm solitude for which he had been yearning while entangled in the complications of the shore. Beneath him the pintles of the rudder were groaning in the gudgeons, and the sea was seething yeastily in white foam under the counter.',\n",
       " 'The glass had been falling since yesterday, he remembered, and the weather was obviously working up into a nor’easterly gale. Hounded before it, across the Bay of Biscay, he could see no respite before him for days, at this moment when he felt he could give everything he had in the world for the calm of the Hamoaze again. His officers were never sick, he thought resentfully, or if they were they were just sick and did not experience this agonising misery. And forward two hundred seasick landsmen were being driven pitilessly to their tasks by overbearing petty officers. It did a man good to be driven to work despite his seasickness, always provided that discipline was not imperilled thereby as it would be in his case. And he was quite, quite sure that not a soul on board felt as miserable as he did, or even half as miserable. He leaned against the rail again, moaning and blaspheming.',\n",
       " 'Experience told him that in three days he would be over all this and feeling as well as ever in his life, but at the moment the prospect of three days of this was just the same as the prospect of an eternity of it. And the timbers creaked and the rudder groaned and the wind whistled and the sea hissed, everything blending into an inferno of noise as he clung shuddering to the rail.',\n",
       " 'Chapter VI WHEN THE FIRST paroxysm was over Hornblower was able to note that the breeze was undoubtedly freshening. It was gusty, too, sudden squalls bringing flurries of rain which beat into the stern gallery where he was standing. He was suddenly consumed with anxiety as to what would happen aloft if the Sutherland were caught in a wilder squall than usual with a crew unhandy at getting in sail. The thought of the disgrace involved in losing spars or canvas in sight of the whole convoy drove all thought of seasickness out of his head. Quite automatically he went forward to his cabin, put on his pilot coat, and ran up on deck. “Flagship’s shortening sail, sir,” he said, touching his hat. Get the royals in,” said Hornblower, turning to look round the horizon through his glass. The convoy was behaving exactly as convoys always did, scattering before the wind as if they really wanted to be snapped up by a privateer.',\n",
       " 'The Indiamen were in a fairly regular group a mile ahead to leeward, but the six other ships were hull down and spread out far beyond them. “Flagship’s been signalling to the convoy, sir,” said Gerard. Hornblower nearly replied, “I expect she has,” but restrained himself in time and limited himself to the single word “Yes. ” As he spoke a fresh series of flag hoists soared up the Pluto’s halliards. “Caligula’s pendant,” read off the signal midshipman. ” So Bolton was being sent ahead to enforce the orders which the transports had disregarded. Hornblower watched the Caligula reset her royals and go plunging forward over the grey sea in pursuit of the transports. She would have to run down within hailing distance and possibly have to fire a gun or two before she could achieve anything; masters of merchant ships invariably paid no attention at all to flag signals even if they could read them.',\n",
       " 'The Indiamen were getting in their topgallants as well—they had the comfortable habit of shortening sail at nightfall. Happy in the possession of a monopoly of the Eastern trade, and with passengers on board who demanded every luxury, they had no need to worry about slow passages and could take care that their passengers ran no risk of being disturbed in their sleep by the stamping and bustle of taking off sail if the weather changed. But from all appearances it might have been deliberately planned to spread the convoy out still farther. Hornblower wondered how the admiral would respond, and he turned his glass upon the Pluto. Sure enough, she burst into hoist after hoist of signals, hurling frantic instructions at the Indiamen. “I’ll lay he wishes he could courtmartial ’em,” chuckled one midshipman to the other. “Five thousand pounds, those India captains make out of a round voyage,” was the reply.',\n",
       " '“What do they care about admirals? God, who’d be in the Navy?” With night approaching and the wind freshening there was every chance of the convoy being scattered right at the very start of its voyage. Hornblower began to feel that his admiral was not showing to the best advantage. The convoy should have been kept together; in a service which accepted no excuses Sir Percy Leighton stood already condemned. He wondered what he would have done in the admiral’s place, and left the question unanswered, vaguely telling himself the profound truth that discipline did not depend on the power to send before a courtmartial; he did not think that he could have done better. “Sutherland’s pendant,” said the signal midshipman, breaking in on his reverie. His night station was a quarter of a mile to windward of the convoy. Here he was drawing up fast upon the Indiamen to his correct position.',\n",
       " 'He watched the Pluto go down past the Indiamen in the wake of the Caligula; apparently the admiral had decided to make use of his flagship as a connecting link between the halves of the convoy. Night was coming down fast and the wind was still freshening. He tried to walk up and down the reeling deck so as to get some warmth back into his shivering body; his stomach was causing him terrible misgivings again now with this period of waiting. He fetched up against the rail, hanging on while he fought down his weakness. Of all his officers, Gerard, handsome, sarcastic, and able, was the one before whom he was least desirous of vomiting. His head was spinning with seasickness and fatigue, and he thought that if he could only lie down he might perhaps sleep, and in sleep he could forget the heaving misery of his interior. The prospect of being warm and snug in his cot grew more and more urgent and appealing.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower held on grimly until his eye told him, in the fast fading light, that he was in his correct station. ” He took the signal slate and wrote on it, painfully, while warring with his insurgent stomach, the strictest orders his mind could devise to the officer of the watch with regard to keeping in sight, and to windward, of the convoy. He quavered on the last word, and he did not hear Gerard’s “Aye aye, sir,” as he fled below. This time it was agony to vomit, for his stomach was completely empty. Polwheal showed up in the cabin as he came staggering back, and Hornblower cursed him savagely and sent him away again. In his sleeping cabin he fell across his cot, and lay there for twenty minutes before he could rouse himself to sit up. Then he dragged off his two coats, and, still wearing his shirt and waistcoat and breeches, he got under the blankets with a groan. The ship was pitching remorselessly as she ran before the wind, and all the timbers complained in spasmodic chorus.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower set his teeth at every heave, while the cot in which he lay soared upward twenty feet or more and then sank hideously downward under the influence of each successive wave. Nevertheless, with no possibility of consecutive thinking, it was easy for exhaustion to step in. He was so tired that with his mind empty he fell asleep in a few minutes, motion and noise and seasickness notwithstanding. So deeply did he sleep that when he awoke he had to think for a moment before he realised where he was. The heaving and tossing, of which he first became conscious, was familiar and yet unexpected. The door into the after cabin, hooked open, admitted a tiny amount of grey light, in which he blinked round him. Then, simultaneously with the return of recollection, his stomach heaved again.',\n",
       " 'He got precariously to his feet, staggered across the after cabin to the rail of the stern gallery, and then peered miserably across the grey sea in the first faint light of dawn, with the wind whipping round him. There was no sail in sight from there, and the consequent apprehension helped him to recover himself. Putting on coat and greatcoat again, he walked up to the quarterdeck. Gerard was in charge of the deck, so that the middle watch was not yet ended. Hornblower gave a surly nod in reply to Gerard’s salute, and stood looking forward over the grey sea, flecked with white. The breeze was shrilling in the rigging, just strong enough for it to be unnecessary to reef topsails, and right aft, blowing round Hornblower’s ears as he stood with his hands on the carved rail. Ahead lay four of the Indiamen, in a straggling line ahead, and then he saw the fifth and sixth not more than a mile beyond them.',\n",
       " 'Of the flagship, of the transports, of the storeships, of the Caligula, there was nothing to be seen at all. “Masthead, there! What do you see of the flagship?” “Northin’, sir. Northin’ in sight nowhere, sir, ’cepting for the Indiamen, sir. ” And that was that, thought Hornblower, replacing the speaking trumpet. The traverse board showed that the Sutherland had held steadily on her course through the night, and the deck log on the slate showed speeds of eight and nine knots. Before long Ushant should be in sight in this clear weather; he had done all his duty in keeping the Indiamen under his eye, on their course, and under canvas conformable with the weather. He only wished that the queasiness of his stomach would permit him to be quite confident about it, for the gloomy depression of seasickness filled him with foreboding. If a victim had to be found, it would be he, he felt sure.',\n",
       " 'He gauged the strength of the wind and decided that it would be inadvisable to set more sail in the hope of overtaking the rest of the convoy. And with that, having reached the satisfactory conclusion that he could do nothing to avert blame if blame were coming to him, he felt more cheerful. Life at sea had taught him to accept the inevitable philosophically. Eight bells sounded, and he heard the call for the watch below. Hornblower felt Bush’s keen glance directed at him, and ignored it in surly silence. He had made it a rule never to speak unnecessarily, and he had found so much satisfaction in it that he was never going to break it. There was satisfaction to be found now, in paying no attention to Bush, who kept stealing anxious glances at him, ready to respond the moment he was spoken to, like a dog with his master. Then it occurred to Hornblower that he must be cutting a very undignified figure, unshaved and tousled, and probably pale green with seasickness.',\n",
       " 'In the cabin where he sat with his head in his hands all the hanging fitments were swaying in the slow time set by the creaking of the timbers. But as long as he did not look at them he was not uncontrollably sick. When Ushant had been sighted he would lie down and close his eyes. Then Polwheal came in, balancing a tray like a conjuror. “Breakfast, sir,” said Polwheal in a flood of garrulity. “I didn’t know you was up, sir, not till the port watch told me when they came below. Galley fire’s bright an’ I could have it toasted for you in two twos, sir, if you ’uld like it that way. ” Hornblower looked at Polwheal in a sudden flood of suspicion. Polwheal was making no attempt to offer him any of the fresh food, except for bread, which he had sent on board; not a chop or a steak, nor rashers of bacon, nor any of the other delicacies he had bought so recklessly. Yet Polwheal knew he had eaten no dinner yesterday, and Polwheal was usually insistent that he should eat and overeat.',\n",
       " 'He wondered why, therefore, Polwheal should be offering him a Frenchman’s breakfast like this. Polwheal’s stony composure wavered a little under Hornblower’s stare, confirming Hornblower’s suspicions. Polwheal had guessed the secret of his captain’s seasickness. “Put it down,” he rasped, quite unable to say more at the moment. Polwheal put the tray on the table and still lingered. “I’ll pass the word when I want you,” said Hornblower sternly. With his head between his hands he reviewed all of what he could remember of yesterday. Not merely Polwheal, he realised now, but Bush and Gerard—the whole ship’s company, for that matter—knew that he suffered from seasickness. Subtle hints in their bearing proved it, now that he came to think about it. At first the thought merely depressed him, so that he groaned again. And finally his sense of humour asserted itself and he smiled.',\n",
       " 'While he smiled, the pleasant aroma of the coffee reached his nostrils, and he sniffed at it wondering, reacting to the scent in two opposite ways at once, conscious both of the urge of hunger and thirst and of the revulsion of his stomach. He poured coffee for himself and sipped it, keeping his eyes rigidly from the swaying of the cabin fitments. With the blessed warmth of the strong sweet coffee inside him he instinctively began to eat the bread, and it was only when he had cleared the tray that he began to feel qualms of doubt as to the wisdom of what he had done. Even then his luck held, for before the waves of seasickness could overcome him a knock on the cabin door heralded the news that land was in sight, and he could forget them in the activity the news demanded of him. Ushant was not in sight from the deck, but only from the masthead, and Hornblower made no attempt to climb the rigging to see it.',\n",
       " 'But as he stood with the wind whipping round him and the rigging harping over his head he looked over the grey sea eastward to where France lay beyond the horizon. Of all landfalls perhaps this one loomed largest in English naval history. Drake and Blake, Shovel and Rooke, Hawke and Boscawen, Rodney and Jervis and Nelson had all of them stood as he was standing, looking eastward as he was doing. Three quarters of the British mercantile marine rounded Ushant, outward and homeward. As a lieutenant under Pellew in the Indefatigable he had beaten about in sight of Ushant for many weary days during the blockade of Brest. It was in these very waters that the Indefatigable and the Amazon had driven the Droits de l’Homme into the breakers, and a thousand men to their deaths. The details of that wild fight thirteen years ago were as distinct in his memory as those of the battle with the Natividad only nine months back; that was a symptom of approaching old age.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower shook off the meditative gloom which was descending on him, and applied himself to the business of laying a fresh course for Finisterre and directing the Indiamen upon it—the first was a far easier task than the second. It called for an hour of signalling and gunfire before every one of his flock had satisfactorily repeated his signals; it appeared to Hornblower as if the masters of the convoy took pleasure in misunderstanding him, in ignoring him, in repeating incorrectly. The Lord Mornington flew the signal for ten minutes at the dip, as if to indicate that it was not understood; it was only when the Sutherland had borne down almost within hail of her, Hornblower boiling with fury, that she was able to clear the jammed signal halliards and hoist the signal properly.',\n",
       " 'Bush chuckled sardonically at the sight, and began some remark to his captain to the effect that even Indiamen were as inefficient as men of war at the beginning of a commission, but Hornblower stamped away angrily out of earshot, leaving Bush staring after him. The ridiculous incident had annoyed Hornblower on account of his fear lest he himself should appear ridiculous; but it had its effect in prolonging his forgetfulness of his seasickness. It was only after a spell of standing solitary on the starboard side while Bush gave the orders that brought the Sutherland up to windward of the convoy again that he calmed down and began to experience internal misgivings once more. He was on the point of retiring below when a sudden cry from Bush recalled him to the quarterdeck. The Walmer Castle was the leading ship of the convoy, and the farthest to port.',\n",
       " 'She was about three miles away, and there was no mistaking the fact that she had spun round on her heel and was now clawing frantically up to windward towards them. “She’s signalling, sir,” said Vincent, “but I can’t read it. 29, but that’s ‘Discontinue the action’ and she can’t mean that. ” The next ship in the straggling line had come up into the wind too; Savage was halfway up the rigging when the masthead lookout hailed. ” Luggers off Ushant could only mean French privateers. Swift, handy, and full of men, with a length of experience at sea only equalled by that of the British Navy, they would court any danger to make a prize of a fat East Indiaman. Such a capture would make their captains wealthy men. Bush, Vincent, everyone on the quarterdeck looked at Hornblower. If he were to lose such a ship entrusted to his charge he would forfeit every bit of credit at the Admiralty that he possessed.',\n",
       " 'In the excitement of instant action he had no thought for the dramatic aspect of affairs, forgot the need to pose, and made no attempt to impress his subordinates with his calm; and the calculations which came flooding up into his mind had so rapidly engrossed him that he betrayed no excitement whatever, as they saw. The Indiamen all carried guns—the Lord Mornington actually had eighteen ports a side—and could beat off any long range attack by a small privateer. The luggers’ tactics would be to swoop alongside and board; no boarding nettings manned by an Indiaman’s crew would keep out a hundred Frenchmen mad for gold. They would manœuvre so as to cut off a ship to windward of him—while he was beating up against the wind they could rush her in three minutes and carry her off under his very eyes.',\n",
       " 'He must not allow such a situation to arise, and yet the Indiamen were slow, his crew was undrilled, and French luggers were as quick as lightning in stays—there were two of them, as well, and he would have to parry two thrusts at once. They were in sight now from the deck, their dark sails lifting above the horizon, two–masted and close–hauled. The dark squares of their sails were urgent with menace, and Hornblower’s eye could read more than the mere drama of the silhouettes against the clear horizon. They were small, with not more than twenty guns apiece, and no more than nine–pounders at that—the Sutherland could sink them with a couple of broadsides if they were ever foolish enough to come within close range. But they were fast; already they were hull–up, and Hornblower could see the white water under their bows. And they were lying at least a point nearer the wind than ever he could induce the Sutherland to lie.',\n",
       " 'Each would have at least a hundred and fifty men on board, because French privateers had little thought for the comfort of their crews, nor needed to when they only intended to dash out of port, snap up a prize, and dash back again. “Shall I clear for action, sir?” asked Bush, greatly daring. ” There was no need to knock down bulkheads and risk spoiling his property and imperil the livestock on board, because there was no chance of a stand–up fight. But a stray nine–pounder ball into the galley fire might set the whole ship ablaze. The men went to their stations, were pushed there, or led there—some of the men were still confused between port and starboard sides—to the accompaniment of the low–voiced threats and curses of the petty officers. “I’ll have the guns loaded and run out, too, if you please, Mr. ” More than half the men had never seen a cannon fired in their lives. This was the first time they had even heard the strange mad music of the gun trucks rumbling over the planking.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower heard it with a catch in his breath—it called up many memories. The privateers gave no sign of flinching when the Sutherland showed her teeth, as Hornblower, watching them closely, saw. They held steadily on their course, heading close–hauled to meet the convoy. But their appearance, Hornblower was glad to see, had done more to herd the merchantmen together than his orders had done. They were huddled together in a mass, each ship closer aboard its neighbour than any merchant captain could be induced to steer save under the impulse of fear. He could see boarding nettings being run up on board them, and they were running out their guns. The defence they could offer would only be feeble, but the fact that they could defend themselves at all was important in the present state of affairs.',\n",
       " 'A puff of smoke and a dull report from the leading privateer showed that she had opened fire; where the shot went Hornblower could not see, but the tricolour flag soared up each of the luggers’ mainmasts, and at a word from Hornblower the red ensign rose to the Sutherland’s peak in reply to this jaunty challenge. Next moment the luggers neared the Walmer Castle, the leading ship to port, with the evident intention of running alongside. ” The Walmer Castle had sheered off in fright, almost running on board her starboard–side neighbour, who had been forced to put her helm over as well. Then, in the nick of time, the Sutherland came dashing down. The luggers put up their helms and bore away to avoid the menace of her broadside, and their first clumsy rush had been beaten off. It was of supreme importance to preserve his position of advantage to windward of the convoy, whence he could dash forward to the threatened point of danger.',\n",
       " 'The convoy drew slowly ahead, with the luggers leading them. Hornblower watched them steadily, the practice of years enabling him to keep them in the focus of his telescope as he stood on the heaving deck. They spun round suddenly on the starboard tack again, moving like clockwork, leaping to meet the Lord Mornington on the starboard wing like hounds at the throat of a stag. The Lord Mornington sheered out of her course, the Sutherland came tearing down upon her, and the luggers went about, instantly, heading for the Walmer Castle again. The Walmer Castle, to his vast relief, managed to throw her topsails aback, and the Sutherland reached her just in time. She swept across her stern; Hornblower could see her whiskered captain in his formal blue frock coat beside her wheel, and half a dozen Lascar sailors leaping hysterically over her deck. The luggers wore away, just out of gunshot of the Sutherland.',\n",
       " 'There was smoke eddying round one of the other Indiamen; apparently she had loosed off her broadside straight into the blue. “They’re wasting powder there, sir,” volunteered Bush, but Hornblower made no reply, being too busy with his mental calculations. “As long as they have the sense not to scatter—” said Crystal. That was an important consideration; if the convoy once divided he could not hope to defend every portion of it. There was neither honour nor glory to be won in this contest between a ship of the line and two small privateers—if he beat them off the world would think nothing of it, while if any one of the convoy was lost he could imagine only too well the ensuing public outcry. He had thought of signalling to his charges that they should keep together, but he had rejected the idea. Signalling would only confuse them, and half of them would probably misread the signal. It was better to rely on their natural instinct of self–preservation.',\n",
       " 'The privateers had come up into the wind again, and were working to windward directly astern of the Sutherland. From the very look of them, of their sharp black hulls and far–raked masts, Hornblower could guess that they had concerted some new move. He saw the bows of the leader swing to starboard, those of the second one to port. They were diverging, and each with the wind on her quarter came racing down, white water foaming at their bows, lying over to the stiff breeze, each of them a picture of malignant efficiency. As soon as they were clear of the Sutherland they would converge again attacking opposite wings of the convoy. He would hardly have time to beat off first one and then return to chase the other away. He thought wildly for a moment of trying to bring the whole convoy to the wind together, and rejected the plan at once.',\n",
       " 'They would probably spread out in the attempt, if they did not fall foul of each other, and in either case, scattered or crippled, they would fall easy victims to their enemies. All he could do was to attempt to tackle both ships in succession. It might seem hopeless, but there was nothing to be gained in abandoning the only plan possible. He dropped his telescope on the deck, and sprang up onto the rail, hanging on by the mizzen rigging. He stared at his enemies, turning his head from side to side, calculating their speeds and observing their courses, his face set rigid in an intensity of concentration. The lugger to starboard was slightly nearer, and consequently would arrive at the convoy first. He would have a minute or so more in hand to get back to deal with the second if he turned on this one. Another glance confirmed his decision, and he risked his reputation upon it—without a thought now, in the excitement of action, for that reputation of his.',\n",
       " 'The Sutherland swung round, out of the wake of the convoy, and headed to cross the bows of the starboard–side lugger. In turn, to avoid the ponderous broadside which was menacing her, the latter edged away, farther and farther as the Sutherland moved down upon her. By virtue of her vastly superior speed she was forereaching both upon the convoy and the escort; and the Sutherland in her effort to keep between the privateer and the merchantmen was being lured farther and farther away from her proper position to interfere with the designs of the other lugger. Hornblower was aware of that, but it was risk he was compelled to take, and he knew, despairingly, that if the Frenchmen played the right game he would be beaten. He could never drive the first lugger so far away and to leeward as to render her innocuous and still have time enough to get back and deal with the other.',\n",
       " 'Already he was dangerously astray, but he held on his course, almost abreast now both of the convoy and of the lugger to starboard. Then he saw the other lugger turn to make its dash in upon the convoy. “Hard–a–starboard!” The Sutherland came round, heeling over with the wind abeam and a trifle more canvas than was safe. She seemed to tear through the water as she raced for the convoy, which was wheeling in confusion away from the attack. As if through a forest of masts and sails Hornblower could see the dark sails of the lugger swooping down upon the helpless Walmer Castle, which must have responded slowly to her helm, or been badly commanded, and was being left astern by the others. A dozen simultaneous calculations raced through Hornblower’s mind. He was thinking like a highly complex machine, forecasting the course of the lugger, and of the six Indiamen, and making allowances for the possible variations resulting from their captains’ personal traits.',\n",
       " 'He had to bear in mind the speed of the Sutherland, and the rate at which she was drifting to leeward under her press of canvas. To circumnavigate the scattering convoy would take too much time and would deprive him of any opportunity of surprise. He called his orders quietly down to the helmsman, steering for the narrowing gap between two ships. The Lord Mornington saw the two–decker rushing down upon her, and swerved as Hornblower had anticipated. Gerard! Give the lugger a broadside as we pass her!” The Lord Mornington was past and gone in a flash; beyond her was the Europe—she had worn round a little and seemed to be heading straight for a collision. “God ——” The Sutherland had shaved across her bows, her jib boom almost brushing the Sutherland’s mizzen rigging. Next moment the Sutherland had dashed through the narrowing gap between two more ships. Beyond was the Walmer Castle, and alongside her the lugger, taken completely by surprise at this unexpected appearance.',\n",
       " 'In the stillness which prevailed on board the Sutherland they could hear the pop–popping of small arms—the Frenchmen were scrambling up to the lofty deck of the Indiaman. But as the big two–decker came hurtling down upon him the French captain tried for safety. Hornblower could see the French boarders leaping down again to the lugger, and her vast mainsail rose ponderously under the united effort of two hundred frantic arms. She had boomed off from the Indiaman and came round like a top, but she was five seconds too late. “Back the mizzen tops’l!” snapped Hornblower to Bush. Gerard!” The Sutherland steadied herself for a crushing blow. “Take your aim!” screamed Gerard, mad with excitement. He was by the forward section of guns on the main deck, which would bear first. “Wait till your guns bear! Fire!” The rolling broadside which followed, as the ship slowly swung round, seemed to Hornblower’s tense mind to last for at least five minutes.',\n",
       " 'The intervals between the shots were ragged, and some of the guns were clearly fired before they bore. Elevation was faulty, too, as the splashes both this side of, and far beyond, the lugger bore witness. He saw splinters flying in the lugger, a couple of shrouds part. Two sudden swirls in the crowd on her deck showed where cannon balls had ploughed through it. The brisk breeze blew the smoke of the straggling broadside clear instantly, so that his view of the lugger a hundred yards away was uninterrupted. Her sails were filled, and she was slipping fast through the water. He gave the orders to the helmsman which would cause the Sutherland to yaw again and bring her broadside to bear. As he did so nine puffs of smoke from the lugger’s side gave warning that she was firing her six–pounder popguns. A musical tone like a brief expiring note on an organ sang in his ear as a shot passed close overhead, and a double crash below told him that the Sutherland was hit.',\n",
       " 'Her thick timbers ought to keep out six–pounder shot at that range. He heard the rumble of the trucks as the Sutherland’s guns were run out again, and he leaned over the rail to shout to the men on the main deck. “Wait till your sights bear!” The guns went off in ones and twos down the Sutherland’s side as she yawed. There was only one old hand at each of the Sutherland’s seventy four guns, and although the officers in charge of the port–side battery had sent over some of their men to help on the starboard side they would naturally keep the trained layers in case the port–side guns had to be worked suddenly. And there were not seventy four good gun layers left over from the Lydia’s old crew—he remembered the difficulty he had experienced in drawing up the watch bill. “Stop your vents!” shouted Gerard, and then his voice went up into a scream of excitement.',\n",
       " '“There it goes! Well done, men!” The big mainmast of the lugger, with the mainsail and topmast and shrouds and all, was leaning over to one side. It seemed to hang there naturally, for a whole breathing space, before it fell with a sudden swoop. Even then a single shot fired from her aftermost gun proclaimed the Frenchman’s defiance. Hornblower turned back to the helmsman to give the orders that would take the Sutherland within pistol shot and complete the little ship’s destruction. Just in time he remembered his duty; he was granting the other lugger time to get in among the convoy, and every second was of value. He noted his excitement as a curious and interesting phenomenon, while his orders brought the Sutherland round on the other tack. As she squared away a long shout of defiance rose from the lugger, lying rolling madly in the heavy sea, her black hull resembling some crippled water beetle. “You’ve a long day’s work ahead of you before you see Brest again.',\n",
       " '” The Sutherland thrashed away on her new course; the convoy had all turned and were beating up towards her, the lugger on their heels like a dog after a flock of sheep. At the sight of the Sutherland rushing down upon her she sheered off again. Obstinately, she worked round to make a dash at the Walmer Castle—steering wide as usual—but Hornblower swung the Sutherland round and the Walmer Castle scuttled towards her for protection. It was easy enough, even in a clumsy ship like the Sutherland, to fend off the attacks of a single enemy. The Frenchman realised this after a few minutes more, and bore away to the help of her crippled consort. Hornblower watched the big lugsail come round and fill, and the lugger lying over as she thrashed her way to windward; already the dismasted Frenchman was out of sight from the Sutherland’s quarterdeck.',\n",
       " 'It was a relief to see the Frenchman go—if he had been in command of her he would have left the other to look after herself and hung onto the convoy until nightfall; it would have been strange if he had not been able to snap up a straggler in the darkness. Someone on the main deck started to cheer, and the cheering was taken up by the rest of the crew. They were waving their hands or their hats as if a Trafalgar had just been won. “Stop that noise,” shouted Hornblower, hot with rage. ” They came, all of them, grinning with excitement, pushing and playing like schoolboys; even the rawest of them had forgotten his seasickness in the excitement of the battle. Hornblower’s blood boiled as he looked down at them, the silly fools.',\n",
       " '“What have you done? Frightened off a couple of luggers not much bigger than our longboat! Two broadsides from a seventy four, and you’re pleased with yourselves for knocking away a single spar! God, you ought to have blown the Frenchie out of the water! Two broadsides, you pitiful baby school! You must lay your guns better than that when it comes to real fighting, and I’ll see you learn how—me and the cat between us. And how d’you make sail? I’ve seen it done better by Portuguese niggers!” There was no denying the fact that words spoken from a full heart carry more weight than all the artifices of rhetoric. Hornblower’s genuine rage and sincerity had made a deep impression, so stirred up had he been at the sight of botched and bungling work. The men were hanging their heads now, and shifting uneasily from one foot to the other, as they realised that what they had done had not been so marvellous after all.',\n",
       " 'And to do them justice, half their exhilaration arose from the mad excitement of the Sutherland’s rush through the convoy, with ships close on either hand. In later years, when they were spinning yarns of past commissions, the story would be embroidered until they began to affirm that Hornblower had steered a two–decker in a howling storm through a fleet of two hundred sail all on opposing courses. “And when the hands have had their breakfasts you can exercise them aloft. ” In the reaction following his excitement he was yearning to get away to the solitude of the stern gallery again. But here came Walsh the surgeon, trotting up to the quarterdeck and touching his hat. “Who’s killed?” “John Hart, midshipman,” answered Walsh. Hart had been a promising seaman in the Lydia, and it was Hornblower himself who had promoted him to the quarterdeck and obtained his warrant for him. “I can mark him ‘mortally wounded,’ sir, if you prefer it,” said Walsh.',\n",
       " '“He lost a leg when a six–pounder ball came in through No. He was alive when they got him down to the cockpit, but he died the next minute. ” Walsh was a new appointment, who had not served under Hornblower before. Otherwise he might have known better than to indulge in details of this sort with so much professional relish. “Get out of my road, blast you,” snarled Hornblower. There would have to be a burial later in the day, with flag half–mast and yards a–cockbill. And it was Hart who was dead—a big gangling young man with a wide, pleasant smile. The thought of it robbed him of all pleasure in his achievements this morning. Bush was there on the quarterdeck, smiling happily both at the thought of what had been done today and at the thought of four solid hours’ exercise aloft for the hands. He would have liked to talk, and Gerard was there, eager to discuss the working of his beloved guns.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower glared at them, daring them to address one single word to him; but they had served with him for years, and knew better. He turned and went below; the ships of the convoy were sending up flags—the sort of silly signals of congratulation one might expect of Indiamen, probably half of them misspelled. He could rely on Bush to hoist “Not understood” until the silly fools got it right, and then to make a mere acknowledgment. He wanted nothing to do with them, or with anybody else. The one shred of comfort in a world which he hated was that, with a following wind and the convoy to leeward, he would be private in his stern gallery, concealed even from inquisitive telescopes in the other ships.',\n",
       " 'Chapter VII HORNBLOWER TOOK a last pull at his cigar when he heard the drum beating to divisions. He exhaled a lungful of smoke, his head thrown back, looking out from under the cove of the stern gallery up at the blissful blue sky, and then down at the blue water beneath, with the dazzling white foam surging from under the Sutherland’s counter into her wake. Overhead he heard the measured tramp of the marines as they formed up across the poop deck, and then a brief shuffle of heavy boots as they dressed their line in obedience to the captain’s order. The patter of hundreds of pairs of feet acted as a subdued accompaniment as the crew formed up round the decks. When everything had fallen still again Hornblower pitched his cigar overboard, hitched his full–dress coat into position, settled his cocked hat on his head, and walked with dignity, his left hand on his swordhilt, forward to the half deck and up the companion ladder to the quarterdeck.',\n",
       " 'Bush was there, and Crystal, and the midshipmen of the watch. They saluted him, and from farther aft came the snick–snack–snick of the marines presenting arms. Hornblower stood and looked round him in leisurely fashion; on this Sunday morning it was his duty to inspect the ship, and he could take advantage of the fact to drink in all the beauty and the artistry of the scene. Overhead the pyramids of white canvas described slow cones against the blue sky with the gentle roll of the ship. The decks were snowy white—Bush had succeeded in that in ten days’ labour—and the intense orderliness of a ship of war was still more intense on this morning of Sunday inspection. Hornblower shot a searching glance from under lowered eyelids at the crew ranged in long single lines along the gangways and on the main deck. They were standing still, smart enough in their duck frocks and trousers.',\n",
       " 'It was their bearing that he wished to study, and that could be done more effectively in a sweeping glance from the quarterdeck than at the close range of the inspection. There could be a certain hint of insolence in the way a restive crew stood to attention, and one could perceive lassitude in a dispirited crew. He could see neither now, for which he was thankful. Ten days of hard work, of constant drill, of unsleeping supervision, of justice tempered by good humour, had done much to settle the hands to their duty. He had had to order five floggings three days ago, forcing himself to stand apparently unmoved while the whistle and crack of the cat–o’–nine–tails sickened his stomach. One of those floggings might do a little good to the recipient—an old hand who had apparently forgotten what he had learned and needed a sharp reminder of it.',\n",
       " 'The other four would do none to the men whose backs had been lacerated; they would never make good sailors and were mere brutes whom brutal treatment could at least make no worse. He had sacrificed them to show the wilder spirits what might happen as a result of inattention to orders—it was only by an actual demonstration that one could work on the minds of uneducated men. The dose had to be prescribed with the utmost accuracy, neither too great nor too small. He seemed, so his sweeping glance told him, to have hit it off exactly. Once more he looked round to enjoy the beauty of it all—the orderly ship, the white sails, the blue sky; the scarlet and pipeclay of the marines, the blue and gold of the officers; and there was consummate artistry in the subtle indications that despite the inspection the real pulsating life of the ship was going on beneath it.',\n",
       " 'Where four hundred and more men stood at attention awaiting his lightest word, the quartermaster at the wheel with his mind on the binnacle and the leach of the main course, the lookouts at the masthead, and the officer of the watch with his telescope were living demonstrations of the fact the ship must still be sailed and the King’s service carried on. He walked up and down the quadruple ranks of the marines, but although he ran his eye mechanically over the men he took notice of nothing. Captain Morris and his sergeants could be relied upon to attend to details like the pipeclaying of belts and the polishing of buttons. Marines could be drilled and disciplined into machines in a way sailors could not be; he could take the marines for granted and he was not interested in them. Even now, after ten days, he hardly knew the faces and names of six out of the ninety marines on board. He passed on to the lines of seamen, the officers of each division standing rigidly in front.',\n",
       " 'The men were trim and smart in their whites—Hornblower wondered how many of them ever realised that the cost of their clothing was deducted from the meagre pay they received when they were paid off. Some of the new hands were horribly sunburned, as a result of unwise exposure to the sudden blazing sun of yesterday. A blond burly figure here had lost the skin from his forearms as well as from his neck and forehead. Hornblower recognised him as Waites, condemned for sheepstealing at Exeter assizes—that explained the sunburn, for Waites had been blanched by months of imprisonment awaiting trial. “See that this man Waites,” said Hornblower to the petty officer of the division, “attends the surgeon this afternoon. He is to have goose grease for those burns, and whatever lotions the surgeon prescribes. Hornblower passed on down the line, scanning each man closely. Faces well remembered, faces it was still an effort to put a name to.',\n",
       " 'Faces that he had studied two years back in the far Pacific on board the Lydia, faces he had first seen when Gerard brought back his boatload of bewildered captives from St. Swarthy faces and pale, boys and elderly men, blue eyes, brown eyes, grey eyes. A host of tiny impressions were collecting in Hornblower’s mind; they would be digested together later during his solitary walks in the stern gallery, to form the raw material for the plans he would make to further the efficiency of his crew. “That man Simms ought to be rated captain of the mizzen top. One of Goddard’s gang—it looks as if he’s still resenting Goddard’s flogging. ” The sun blazed down upon them, while the ship lifted and swooped over the gentle sea. From the crew he turned his attention to the ship—the breechings of the guns, the way the falls were flemished down, the cleanliness of the decks, the galley and the forecastle. At all this he need only pretend to look—the skies would fall before Bush neglected his duty.',\n",
       " 'But he had to go through with it, with a show of solemnity. Men were oddly influenced—the poor fools would work better for Bush if they thought Hornblower was keeping an eye on him, and they would work better for Hornblower if they thought he inspected the ship thoroughly. This wretched business of capturing men’s devotion set Hornblower smiling cynically when he was unobserved. Bush,” said Hornblower, returning to the quarterdeck. ” It was a God–fearing Admiralty who ordered church service every Sunday morning, otherwise Hornblower would have dispensed with it, as befitted a profound student of Gibbon. As it was, he had managed to evade having a chaplain on board—Hornblower hated parsons. He watched the men dragging up mess stools for themselves, and chairs for the officers. They were working diligently and cheerfully, although not with quite that disciplined purposefulness which characterised a fully trained crew.',\n",
       " 'His coxswain Brown covered the compass box on the quarterdeck with a cloth, and laid on it, with due solemnity, Hornblower’s Bible and prayer book. Hornblower disliked these services; there was always the chance that some devout member of his compulsory congregation might raise objections to having to attend—Catholic or Nonconformist. Religion was the only power which could ever pit itself against the bonds of discipline; Hornblower remembered a theologically minded master’s mate who had once protested against his reading the benediction, as though he, the King’s representative at sea—God’s representative, when all was said and done—could not read a benediction if he chose! He glowered at the men as they settled down, and began to read. As the thing had to be done, it might as well be done well, and, as ever, while he read he was struck once more by the beauty of Cranmer’s prose and the deftness of his adaptation.',\n",
       " 'Cranmer had been burned alive two hundred and fifty years before—did it benefit him at all to have his prayer book read now? Bush read the lessons in a tuneless bellow as if he were hailing the foretop. Then Hornblower read the opening lines of the hymn, and Sullivan the fiddler played the first bars of the tune. Bush gave the signal for the singing to start—Hornblower could never bring himself to do that; he told himself he was neither a mountebank nor an Italian opera conductor—and the crew opened their throats and roared it out. A captain could often discover a good deal about the spirits of his crew by the way they sang their hymns. This morning either the hymn chosen was specially popular or the crew were happy in the new sunshine, for they were singing lustily, with Sullivan sawing away at an ecstatic obligato on his fiddle.',\n",
       " 'The Cornishmen among the crew apparently knew the hymn well, and fell upon it with a will, singing in parts to add a leavening of harmony to the tuneless bellowings of the others. It all meant nothing to Hornblower—one tune was the same as another to his tone–deaf ear, and the most beautiful music was to him no more than comparable to the noise of a cart along a gravel road. As he listened to the unmeaning din, and gazed at the hundreds of gaping mouths, he found himself wondering as usual whether or not there was any basis of fact in this legend of music—whether other people actually heard something more than mere noise, or whether he was the only person on board not guilty of willful self–deception. He was weeping broken–heartedly, even while he tried to keep his back straight and to conceal his emotions, with the big tears running down his cheeks and his nose all beslobbered. The poor little devil had been touched in one way or another—some chord of memory had been struck.',\n",
       " 'Perhaps the last time he had heard that hymn was in the little church at home, beside his mother and brothers. Hornblower was glad for his sake as well as for his own when the hymn came to an end; the next ceremony would steady the boy again. He took up the Articles of War and began to read them, as the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty had ordained should be done each Sunday in every one of His Britannic Majesty’s ships. He knew the solemn sentences by heart at this, his five hundredth reading, every cadence, every turn of phrase, and he read them well. This was better than any vague religious service or Thirty Nine Articles. Here was a code in black and white, a stern, unemotional call to duty pure and simple. Some Admiralty clerk or pettifogging lawyer had had a gift of phrasing just as felicitous as Cranmer’s.',\n",
       " 'There was no trumpet call about it, no claptrap appeal to sentiment; there was merely the cold logic of the code which kept the British Navy at sea, and which had guarded England during seventeen years of a struggle for life. He could tell by the deathlike stillness of his audience as he read that their attention had been caught and held, and when he folded the paper away and looked up he could see solemn, set faces. The ship’s boy in the front row had forgotten his tears. There was a faraway look in his eyes; obviously he was making good resolutions to attend more strictly to his duty in future. Or perhaps he was dreaming wild dreams of the time to come when he would be a captain in a gold–laced coat commanding a seventy four, or of brave deeds which he would do.',\n",
       " 'In a sudden revulsion of feeling Hornblower wondered if lofty sentiment would armour the boy against cannon shot—he remembered another ship’s boy who had been smashed into a red jam before his eyes by a shot from the Natividad.',\n",
       " 'Chapter VIII IN THE AFTERNOON Hornblower was walking his quarterdeck; the problem before him was so difficult that he had quitted his stern gallery—he could not walk fast enough there, owing to his having to bend his head, to set his thoughts going. The people on the quarterdeck saw his mood, and kept warily over to the lee side, leaving the whole weather side, nearly thirty yards of quarterdeck and gangway, to him. Up and down he walked, up and down, trying to nerve himself to make the decision he hankered after. The Sutherland was slipping slowly through the water with a westerly breeze abeam; the convoy were clustered together only a few cables’ lengths to leeward. “Boat pulling towards us from Lord Mornington, sir,” he said.',\n",
       " 'He wanted to warn his captain of the approach of visitors, so that if he thought fit he could make himself unapproachable in his cabin; but he knew, as well as Hornblower did, that it might be unwise for a captain to act in too cavalier a fashion towards the notabilities on board the East India convoy. Hornblower looked across at the boat creeping beetlelike towards him. Ten days of a strong northeasterly wind had not merely hurried the convoy to the latitude of North Africa where he was to leave them to their own devices, but had prevented all intercourse and visiting between ships until yesterday. Yesterday there had been a good deal of coming and going between the ships of the convoy; it was only natural that today he should receive formal calls, which he could not well refuse. In another two hours they would be parting company—it could not be a prolonged ordeal.',\n",
       " 'The boat ran alongside, and Hornblower walked forward to receive his two guests—Captain Osborn of the Lord Mornington, in his formal frock coat, and someone else, tall and bony, resplendent in civilian full dress with ribbon and star. “I wish to present you to Lord Eastlake, Governor–designate of Bombay. “I have come,” said Lord Eastlake, clearing his throat, “to beg of you, Captain Hornblower, to receive on behalf of your ship’s company this purse of four hundred guineas. It has been subscribed by the passengers of the East India convoy in recognition of the skill and courage displayed by the Sutherland in the action with the two French privateers off Ushant. ” “In the name of my ship’s company I thank your lordship,” said Hornblower. It was a very handsome gesture, and as he took the purse he felt like Judas, knowing what designs he was cherishing against the East India convoy.',\n",
       " '“And I,” said Osborn, “am the bearer of a most cordial invitation to you and to your first lieutenant to join us at dinner in the Lord Mornington. ” At that Hornblower shook his head with apparent regret. I am deeply hurt by the necessity of having to refuse. ” “We shall all be sorry on board the Lord Mornington,” said Lord Eastlake. “Ten days of bad weather have deprived us of the pleasure of the company of any of the officers of the Navy. Cannot you be persuaded to alter your decision?” “This has been the quickest passage I have made to these latitudes,” said Osborn. “I begin to regret it now that it appears to have prevented our seeing anything of you. ” “I am on the King’s service, my lord, and under the most explicit orders from the admiral. ” That was an excuse against which the Governor–designate of Bombay could not argue.',\n",
       " '“At least, can I have the pleasure of making the acquaintance of your officers?” Once more that was a handsome gesture; Hornblower called them up and presented them one by one; horny–handed Bush, and Gerard handsome and elegant, Captain Morris of the marines and his two gawky subalterns, the other lieutenants and the master, down to the junior midshipman, all of them delighted and embarrassed at this encounter with a lord. ” Hornblower stood weighing the purse—an embroidered canvas bag at which someone had laboured hard recently—in his hand. He felt the weight of the gold, and under his fingers he felt the crackle of the bank notes. He would have liked to treat it as prize money, and take his share under prize money rules, but he knew he could not accept that sort of reward from civilians. ” Lord Eastlake and Captain Osborn acknowledged the compliment as they pulled away; Hornblower watched the boat creep back to the Lord Mornington.',\n",
       " 'It was a lot of money, but he was not going to be bought off with four hundred guineas. In that very moment he came to his decision, after twenty four hours of vacillation. He would display to the East India convoy the independence of Captain Hornblower. Have the helm put up and run down to leeward of the convoy. I want those boats in the water by the time we reach them. ” Amid the bustle and hurry of wearing the ship, and tailing on at the stay tackles, Hornblower gave his orders briefly. For once in his life Bush ventured to demur when he realised what Hornblower had in mind. “I had myself fancied that such was the case,” said Hornblower with elaborate irony. He knew perfectly well the risk he was running in taking men from ships of the East India Company—he would be both offending the most powerful corporation in England and contravening Admiralty orders.',\n",
       " 'But he needed the men, needed them desperately, and the ships from whom he was taking them would sight no land until they reached St. It would be three or four months before any protest could reach England, and six months before any censure could reach him in the Mediterranean. A crime six months old might not be prosecuted with extreme severity; and perhaps in six months’ time he would be dead. “Give the boats’ crews pistols and cutlasses,” he said, “just to show that I’ll stand no nonsense. And able seamen every one of them, men who can hand, reef, and steer. And find out who their quarter gunners are, and bring them. You can use some trained gunners, Gerard?” “By God I can, sir. He had reached his decision unaided, and he did not want to discuss it further. First the launch and then the cutter dropped into the water and pulled over to the clustered ships, while the Sutherland dropped farther down to leeward to await their return, hove to with main topsail to the mast.',\n",
       " 'Through his glass Hornblower saw the flash of steel as Gerard with his boarding party ran up onto the deck of the Lord Mornington—he was displaying his armed force early so as to overawe any thought of resistance. Hornblower was in a fever of anxiety which he had to struggle hard to conceal. He shut his glass with a snap and began to pace the deck. “Boat pulling towards us from Lord Mornington, sir,” said Rayner, who was as excited as his captain, and far more obviously. “Very good,” said Hornblower with careful unconcern. If Osborn had given Gerard a pointblank refusal, had called his men to arms and defied him, it might give rise to a nasty situation. A court of law might call it murder if someone got killed in a scuffle while illegal demands were being enforced. But he had counted on Osborn being taken completely by surprise when the boarding party ran onto his deck.',\n",
       " 'Now Hornblower’s calculations were proving correct; Osborn was sending a protest, and he was prepared to deal with any number of protests—especially as the rest of the convoy would wait on their Commodore’s example and could be relieved of their men while the protesting was going on. It was Osborn himself who came in through the entry port, scarlet with rage and offended dignity. “Captain Hornblower!” he said, as he set foot on the deck. “This is an outrage! I must protest against it, sir. At this very moment your lieutenant is parading my crew with a view to impressment. ” “He is acting by my orders, sir,” said Hornblower. Are you aware, sir, that what you propose to do is contrary to the law? It is a flagrant violation of Admiralty regulations. The ships of the Honourable East India Company are exempt from impressment, and I, as Commodore, must protest to the last breath of my body against any contravention of the law. ” “I shall be glad to receive your protest when you make it, sir.',\n",
       " '“I thought these were only remarks preliminary to a protest. ” “Nothing of the sort,” raved Osborn, his portly form almost dancing on the deck. “I have protested, sir, and I shall continue to protest. I shall call the attention of the highest in the land to this outrage. I shall come from the ends of the earth, gladly, sir, to bear witness at your courtmartial. I shall not rest—I shall leave no stone unturned—I shall exert all my influence to have this crime punished as it deserves. I’ll have you cast in damages, sir, as well as broke. ” “But, Captain Osborn——” began Hornblower, changing his tune just in time to delay the dramatic departure which Osborn was about to make. From the tail of his eye Hornblower had seen the Sutherland’s boats pulling towards two more victims, having presumably stripped the first two of all possible recruits. As Hornblower began to hint at a possible change of mind on his part, Osborn rapidly lost his ill temper.',\n",
       " '“If you restore the men, sir, I will gladly retract all I have said,” said Osborn. “Nothing more will be heard of the incident, I assure you. ” “But will you not allow me to ask for volunteers from among your crews, Captain?” pleaded Hornblower. “There may be a few men who would like to join the King’s service. As you say, sir, you may find a few restless spirits. ” That was the height of magnanimity on Osborn’s part, although he was safe in assuming that there would be few men in his fleet foolish enough to exchange the comparative comfort of the East India Company’s service for the rigours of life in the Royal Navy. “Your seamanship in that affair with the privateers, sir, was so admirable that I find it hard to refuse you anything,” said Osborn, pacifically. The Sutherland’s boats were alongside the last of the convoy now. “That is very good of you, sir,” said Hornblower, bowing.',\n",
       " 'Since they will have taken volunteers first, we can rely upon it that they will have all the willing ones on board, and I shall return the unwilling ones. ” He saw Captain Osborn over the side and walked back to the quarterdeck. Rayner was eyeing him with amazement on account of his sudden volte–face, which gave him pleasure, for Rayner would be still more amazed soon. The cutter and launch, both of them as full of men as they well could be, were running down now to rejoin, passing Osborn’s gig as it was making its slow course to windward. Through his glass Hornblower could see Osborn wave his arm as he sat in his gig; presumably he was shouting something to the boats as they went by. Bush and Gerard very properly paid him no attention. In two minutes they were alongside, and the men came pouring on deck, a hundred and twenty men laden with their small possessions, escorted by thirty of the Sutherland’s hands. They were made welcome by the rest of the crew, all with broad grins.',\n",
       " 'It was a peculiarity of the British pressed sailor that he was always glad to see other men pressed—in the same way, thought Hornblower, as the fox who lost his brush wanted all the other foxes to lose theirs. Bush and Gerard had certainly secured a fine body of men; Hornblower looked them over as they stood in apathy, or bewilderment, or sullen rage, upon the Sutherland’s main deck. At no warning they had been snatched from the comfort of an Indiaman, with regular pay, ample food, and easy discipline, into the hardships of the King’s service, where the pay was problematic, the food bad, and where their backs were liable to be flogged to the bones at a simple order from their new captain. Even a sailor before the mast could look forward with pleasure to his visit to India, with all its possibilities; but these men were destined instead now to two years of monotony only varied by danger, where disease and the cannon balls of the enemy lay in wait for them.',\n",
       " 'Rayner’s eyelids flickered for a second—he had heard Hornblower’s promise to Captain Osborn, and he knew that more than a hundred of the new arrivals would refuse to volunteer. The boats would only have to be hoisted out again to take them back. But if Hornblower’s wooden expression indicated anything at all, it was that he meant what he said. Bush was approaching now, paper in hand, having agreed his figures regarding the recruits with Gerard. “A hundred and twenty, total, sir, as you ordered,” said Bush. “One cooper’s mate—he was a volunteer, one hundred and nine able seamen—two of ’em volunteered; six quarter gunners; four landsmen, all volunteers. Rayner, square away as soon as those boats are inboard. ’ You’ll have to spell out ‘volunteered,’ but it’s worth it. ” Hornblower’s high spirits had lured him into saying an unnecessary sentence. But when he took himself to task for it he could readily excuse himself.',\n",
       " 'He had a hundred and twenty new hands, nearly all of them able seamen—the Sutherland had nearly her full complement now. More than that, he had guarded himself against the wrath to come. When the inevitable chiding letter arrived from the Admiralty he would be able to write back and say that he had taken the men with the East India Company’s Commodore’s permission; with any good fortune he could keep the ball rolling for another six months. That would give him a year altogether in which to convince the new hands that they had volunteered—by that time some of them at least might be sufficiently enamoured of their new life to swear to that; enough of them to befog the issue, and to afford to an Admiralty, prepared of necessity to look with indulgence on breaches of the pressing regulations, a loophole of excuse not to prosecute him too hard. Await boat’!” “Signal ‘Good–bye’ again,” said Hornblower.',\n",
       " 'Down on the main deck Bush had nearly finished reading through the Articles of War to the new hands—the necessary formality to make them servants of the King, submissive to the hangman and the cat.',\n",
       " 'Chapter IX THE Sutherland had reached her rendezvous off Palamos Point, apparently the first of the squadron, for there was no sign as yet of the flagship or of the Caligula. As she beat slowly up under easy sail against the gentle southeasterly wind Gerard was taking advantage of this period of idleness to exercise the crew at the guns. Bush had too long had his way in drilling the crew aloft; it was time for practice with the big guns, as Hornblower had agreed. Under the scorching sun of a Mediterranean midsummer the men, naked to the waist, had sweated rivers running the guns out and in again, training round with handspikes, each man of the crew learning the knack of the flexible rammer—all the mechanical drill which every man at the guns had to learn until he could be trusted to run up, fire, clean, and reload, and to go on doing so for hour after hour, in thick powder smoke and with death all round him.',\n",
       " 'Drill first, marksmanship a long way second, but all the same it was policy to allow the men to fire off the guns a few times—they found compensation in that for the arduous toil at the guns. A thousand yards to port the quarter boat was bobbing over the glittering sea. There was a splash, and then they could see the black dot of the cask she had thrown overboard before pulling hastily out of the line of fire. “Take your aim! Cock your locks! Fire—stop your vents!” The foremost eighteen–pounder roared out briefly while a dozen glasses looked for the splash. 2 gun!” The main–deck eighteen–pounders, the lower–deck twenty–four–pounders, spoke each in turn. Even with experienced gun layers it would have been too much to expect to hit a cask at such a long range in thirty seven shots; the cask still bobbed unharmed. Every gun of the port battery tried again, and still the cask survived. Bush, have the helm put up and run the ship past the cask a cable’s length away.',\n",
       " '” Two hundred yards was a short enough range even for carronades; the forecastle and quarterdeck carronades’ crews stood to their weapons as the Sutherland ran down to the cask. The guns went off nearly simultaneously as they bore, the ship trembling to the concussions, while the thick smoke eddied upwards round the naked men. The water boiled all round the cask, as half a ton of iron tore it up in fountains, and in the midst of the splashes the cask suddenly leaped clear of the water, dissolving into its constituent staves as it did so. All the guns’ crews cheered while Hornblower’s silver whistle split the din as a signal to cease fire, and the men clapped each other on the shoulder exultantly. As Hornblower knew, the fun of knocking a cask to pieces was full compensation for two hours’ hard work at gun drill.',\n",
       " 'The quarter boat dropped another cask; the starboard–side battery prepared to bombard it, while Hornblower stood blinking gratefully in the sunshine on the quarterdeck, feeling glad to be alive. He had as full a crew as any captain could hope for, and more trained topmen than he could ever have dared to expect. So far everyone was healthy; his landsmen were fast becoming seamen, and he would train them into gunners even quicker than that. This blessed midsummer sunshine, hot and dry, suited his health admirably. He had left off fretting over Lady Barbara, thanks to the intense pleasure which it gave him to see his crew settling down into a single efficient unit. He was glad to be alive, with high spirits bubbling up within him. An extraordinarily lucky shot from one of the lower–deck guns had smashed the second cask to fragments. Bush, see that every man of that gun’s crew gets a tot of rum tonight. Heave the ship to on the starboard tack, if you please.',\n",
       " '” Even here, no more than fifty miles from France, and not more than twenty from a corner of Spain under French domination, there was very small chance of any sail being French, especially on the course this one was steering—any French vessel crept along the coast without venturing a mile to sea. “Masthead! What do you make of the sail?” “She’s a ship, sir, wi’ all sail set. ” “Belay!” roared the boatswain’s mate to the hands hoisting in the quarter boat. The fact that the approaching vessel was a full–rigged ship made it more unlikely still that she was French—French commerce was confined to small craft, luggers and brigs and tartans, now. Probably she was one of the ships the Sutherland had come to meet. A moment later the suspicion was confirmed from the masthead. ” So she was; Captain Bolton must have completed his task of escorting the storeships into Port Mahon. Will you dine with me now?’” “Hoist the assent,” replied Hornblower.',\n",
       " 'The pipes of the boatswain’s mates twittered into one last weird wail as Hornblower went up the side of the Caligula; the side boys stood at attention; the marines presented arms; and Captain Bolton came forward, his hand held out and his craggy face wreathed in smiles. I’ve twelve dozen sherry here I’ll be glad to hear your opinion of. Where are those glasses, steward? Your very good health, sir!” Captain Bolton’s after cabin was furnished with a luxury which contrasted oddly to Hornblower’s. There were satin cushions on the lockers; the swinging lamps were of silver, and so were the table appointments on the white linen cloth on the table. Bolton had been lucky in the matter of prize money when in command of a frigate—a single cruise had won him five thousand pounds—and Bolton had started life before the mast. The momentary jealousy which Hornblower experienced evaporated as he noted the poor taste of the cabin fittings, and remembered how dowdy Mrs.',\n",
       " 'More than anything else, Bolton’s obvious pleasure at seeing him, and the genuine respect he evinced in his attitude towards him, combined to give Hornblower a better opinion of himself. “From the rapidity with which you reached the rendezvous, it appears that your passage was even quicker than ours,” said Bolton, and the conversation lapsed into technicalities, which endured even after dinner was served. And clearly Bolton had little idea of what kind of dinner to offer in this scorching heat. Red mullet—a last–minute purchase in Port Mahon at the moment of sailing. No salad, no fruit, not one of the more desirable products of the Minorca Bolton had just left. “Minorquin mutton, I fear,” said Bolton, carvers in hand. “My last English sheep died mysteriously at Gibraltar and provided dinner for the gunroom. But you will take a little more, sir?” “Thank you, no,” said Hornblower.',\n",
       " 'He had eaten manfully through a vast helping, and, gorged with mutton fat, was sitting sweating now in the sweltering cabin. Bolton pushed the wine back to him, and Hornblower poured a few drops into his half–empty glass. A lifetime of practice had made him adept at appearing to drink level with his host while actually drinking one glass to three. “And now,” said Bolton, “we must await in idleness the arrival of Sir Mucho Pomposo, Rear Admiral of the Red. He himself would never have risked speaking of his superior officer as Mucho Pomposo to anyone. Moreover, it had not occurred to him to think of Sir Percy Leighton in that fashion. Criticism of a superior who had yet to demonstrate to him his capacity one way or the other was not Hornblower’s habit; and possibly he was specially slow to criticise a superior who was Lady Barbara’s husband. He had drunk one glass more of port than was quite wise, and was pouring himself out another one.',\n",
       " '“We can sit and polish our backsides while he works that old tub of a Pluto round from Lisbon. If he didn’t pass the Straits two days back it’ll be a week or more before he appears. And if he doesn’t leave all the navigation to Elliott he’ll never arrive at all. If any report of this conversation were to reach higher quarters it would do Bolton no good. They don’t respect an admiral who’s no seaman any more than I do. Well, what have you to say?” Hornblower proffered the suggestion that one of the two ships might push to the northward and begin the task of harassing the French and Spanish coast while the other stayed on the rendezvous awaiting the admiral. Hornblower shook off the lassitude occasioned by the heat and the vast meal inside him. He wanted the Sutherland to be despatched on this duty. He could feel his pulse quickening at the thought, and the more he considered it the more anxious he was that the choice would fall on him.',\n",
       " 'Days of dreary beating about on and off the rendezvous made no appeal to him at all. He could bear it if necessary—twenty years in the Navy would harden anyone to waiting—but he did not want to have to. “You or me?” Hornblower took a grip of his eagerness. “You are the senior officer on the station, sir,” he said. “You’d give three fingers to go,” he said suddenly, “and you know it. You’re the same restless devil that you were in the Indefatigable. I remember beating you for it, in ’93, or was it ’94?” Hornblower flushed hotly at the reminder. The bitter humiliation of being bent over a gun and beaten by the lieutenant of the midshipmen’s berth rankled to this day when it was recalled to him. But he swallowed his resentment; he had no wish to quarrel with Bolton, especially at this juncture, and he knew he was exceptional in regarding a beating as an outrage. ” “And now you’re a post captain, and the most noteworthy one in the bottom half of the list,” said Bolton.',\n",
       " 'I’d let you go, Hornblower, for old times’ sake, if I didn’t want to go myself. His evident disappointment made his expression ludicrous. ” With maddening slowness Bolton reached into his fob and brought out his purse. He took out a guinea and laid it on the table, and then, with the same deliberation, while Hornblower wrestled with his eagerness, he replaced the purse. Then he took up the guinea, and poised it on his gnarled thumb and forefinger. “King or spade?” he asked, looking across at Hornblower. The coin rang as Bolton spun it into the air; he caught it, and crashed it onto the table. Bolton went through all the motions once more of taking out his purse, putting the guinea back, and thrusting the purse into his fob, while Hornblower forced himself to sit still and watch him. He was cool again now, with the immediate prospect of action. You can speak the Dago’s lingo, which is more than I can. I ought to put that in writing, in case his High Mightiness comes back.',\n",
       " '” Hornblower filled it two thirds full—if he left a little in the bottom he would only have drunk half a glass more than he wanted then. He sipped, and leaned back in his chair, restraining his eagerness as long as possible. Hornblower’s attitude was unmistakable, but he could not believe the evidence of his eyes. “There’s a fair wind——” Hornblower was actually stammering as he tried to make all his explanations at once. The wind might change; if it was worth while separating it was better to go now than later; if the Sutherland were to stand in towards the coast during the dark hours there was a chance that she might snap up a prize at dawn—every sort of explanation except the true one that he could not bear to sit still any longer with immediate action awaiting him just over the horizon. Does that mean you don’t like my port?” “No, sir,” said Hornblower, hastily. “Another glass, then, while your boat’s crew is making ready.',\n",
       " '” The last sentence was bellowed towards the closed door of the cabin, and was immediately repeated by the sentry outside. Boatswain’s pipes twittered as Hornblower went down the Caligula’s side, officers stood to attention, side boys held the lines. The gig rowed rapidly over the silver water in the fading evening; Coxswain Brown looked sidelong, anxiously, at his captain, trying to guess what this hurried and early departure meant. In the Sutherland there was similar anxiety; Bush and Gerard and Crystal and Rayner were all on the quarterdeck awaiting him—Bush had obviously turned out of bed at the news that the captain was returning. Hornblower paid no attention to their expectant glances. He had made it a rule to offer no explanations—and there was a pleasurable selfish thrill in keeping his subordinates in ignorance of their future.',\n",
       " 'Even as the gig came leaping up to the tackles he gave the orders which squared the ship away before the wind, heading back to the Spanish coast where adventure awaited them. The officers on the quarterdeck looked at each other, wondering what the future held in store for them for the commodore to wish them good luck. Hornblower noted the interchange of glances without appearing to see them. “Ha—h’m,” he said, and walked with dignity below, to pore over his charts and plan his campaign. The timbers creaked faintly as the gentle wind urged the ship over the almost placid sea.',\n",
       " 'Chapter X “TWO BELLS, sir,” said Polwheal, waking Hornblower from an ecstatic dream. “Wind east by south, course nor’ by east, an’ all sail set to the royal, sir. Gerard says to say land in sight on the larboard beam. ” This last sentence jerked Hornblower from his cot without a moment’s more meditation. He stripped off his nightshirt and put on the clothes Polwheal held ready for him. Unshaved and uncombed he hurried up to the quarterdeck. It was full daylight now, with the sun half clear of the horizon and looking over the starboard quarter, and just abaft the port beam a grey mountain shape reflecting its light. That was Cape Creus, where a spur of the Pyrenees came jutting down to the Mediterranean, carrying the Spanish coast line out to its farthest easterly point. A brig, sir, standing out from the land on the starboard tack. ” It was what Hornblower had been hoping for; it was for this reason that he had laid his course so as to be on this spot at this moment.',\n",
       " 'All the seaboard of Catalonia, as far south as Barcelona and beyond, was in the hands of the French, and a tumultuous French army—the Account of the Present War in Spain estimated it at nearly eighty thousand men—was endeavouring to extend its conquests southwards and inland. But they had Spanish roads to contend against as well as Spanish armies. To supply an army eighty thousand strong, and a large civilian population as well, was impossible by land over the Pyrenean passes, even though Gerona had surrendered last December after a heroic defence. Food and siege materials and ammunition had to be sent by sea, in small craft which crept along the coast, from shore battery to shore battery, through the lagoons and the shallows off the coast of the Gulf of the Lion, past the rocky capes of Spain, as far as Barcelona. Since Cochrane’s recall, this traffic had met with hardly any interference from the British in the Mediterranean.',\n",
       " 'When Hornblower first reached his rendezvous off Palamos Point he had been careful to disappear again over the horizon immediately, so as to give no warning of the approach of a British squadron. With the wind nearly in the east, and Cape Creus running out almost directly eastwards, there was a chance that some supply ship or other, compelled to stand far out from the land to weather the point, might be caught at dawn out of range of the shore batteries, having neglected to make this dangerous passage at night. ” Before the wind, and with only the lightest of breezes blowing, was the Sutherland’s best point of sailing, as might be expected of her shallow build and clumsy beam. In these ideal conditions she might easily have the heels of a deep–laden coasting brig. If the chase had been a ship of the line, she might have been challenging battle. But a mere brig, even a brig of war, would be expected to fly to the shelter of the shore batteries.',\n",
       " 'Can’t read the flags yet, sir, and she’s nearly dead to leeward, now. ” What the devil was the brig up to? She had settled her own fate by standing to windward again; if she had dashed for the land the moment she had sighted the Sutherland she might possibly have escaped. Now she was a certain capture—but why was a French brig signalling to a British ship of the line? Hornblower sprang up onto the rail; from there he could see the brig’s topsails over the horizon, as she held her windward course. ” “What the devil does MV mean?” snapped Hornblower to Vincent, and then regretted that he had said it. “I don’t know, sir,” said Vincent, turning the pages of the signal book. A handsome bit of prize money there for us, my lads. ” The excited chatter of the quarterdeck reached Hornblower’s ears to be unheard. This last attempt at flight on the Frenchman’s part had explained his previous movements.',\n",
       " 'Bush, Gerard, Vincent, Crystal, were all too careless to have thought about it, too excited at the prospect of prize money. At first sight of the Sutherland, the brig had turned to fly. Then she had seen the red ensign which the Sutherland had hoisted, and misread it as the French colours—both sides had made the same mistake before this; the red fly both of tricolour and of red ensign led easily to confusion. It was fortunate this time that Leighton had been Rear Admiral of the Red, so that the Sutherland had worn his colours. What was more, the Sutherland had the round bow given her by her Dutch builders, the same as nearly every French ship of the line, and unlike every English ship save three or four. So the brig had taken the Sutherland to be French, and as soon as she was sure of this had held to the wind again, anxious to make her offing so as to weather Cape Creus.',\n",
       " 'Then the MV signal which she had flown had been the private French recognition signal—that was something well worth knowing. It was only when the Sutherland did not make the expected conventional reply that the French captain had realised his mistake, and made one last dash for liberty. A quite unavailing dash, for the Sutherland had cut her off from all chance of escape to leeward. The ships were only two miles apart now, and converging. Once more the brig came round, this time with the very faint hope of clawing away out of range to windward. The brig hove to, and the tricolour came down from her peak. Take six hands with you and navigate her to Port Mahon. Admiralty agent at Port Mahon’ll buy her, sure as a gun, ship, stores, and all. “And we the only ship in sight!” If any other British ship had been in sight she would have shared the prize money.',\n",
       " 'As it was the only shares to be given away were those of the admiral commanding in the Mediterranean and of Admiral Leighton commanding the squadron. Between them they would have one third of the value, so that Hornblower’s share would be about two ninths—several hundred pounds at least. Not for worlds would he give any sign of his delight at being several hundred pounds richer. ” He went below to shave, and as he scraped the lather from his cheeks and contemplated the melancholy face in the glass he meditated once more on the superiority of sea over land. The Amelie was a small vessel, almost inconsiderable in size. But she carried between two and three hundred tons of stores; and if the French had tried to send that amount overland to Barcelona it would have called for a first–class military convoy—a hundred or more waggons, hundreds of horses, taking up a mile or more of road and needing a guard of thousands of troops to protect it from the attacks of the Spanish partisans.',\n",
       " 'Troops and horses would have needed food, too, and that would call for more waggons still, all crawling along at fifteen miles a day at most over the Spanish roads. Small wonder, then, that the French preferred to run the risk of sending their stores by sea. And what a blow it would be for the harassed French army to find a British squadron on their flank, and their best route of communication broken. Walking forward to take his bath with Polwheal in attendance, a new idea struck him. Potter the sailmaker came aft and stood at attention while Hornblower rotated himself under the jet of the wash–deck pump. “There’s not one on board?” “French ensign, sir? No, sir. ” Hornblower continued to rotate under the jet of the pump, rejoicing in its refreshing impact on this hot morning. The chances were that no Frenchman had observed the capture of the Amelie from Cape Creus, and that was the only land in sight at the time.',\n",
       " 'Even if someone had done so, it would take many hours to warn all the coast line of the presence of a British ship of the line. Having taken the French by surprise, the right game to play was to go on exploiting that surprise to the utmost, making use of every device that would make the blow effective. He went back to his cabin and put on refreshing clean linen, still turning over in his mind the details of his plans which were now losing their nebulousness of the night before and growing more and more clear–cut. “Bring me some coffee on the quarterdeck,” said Hornblower. He could not bear the thought of food—perhaps because of his present excitement, perhaps because of his enormous dinner of the night before. From the quarterdeck could be seen shadowy blue masses on the horizon right ahead—the peaks of the Pyrenees; between them and the sea crawled the road from France to Spain. The sailmaker’s mate came running aft with his arms full of a vast bundle.',\n",
       " '” The officers on the quarterdeck eyed the strange tricolour as it rose to the peak, and they looked from the flag to their captain, whispering among themselves. Grouped on the lee side, not one of them dared to try to open a conversation with Hornblower on the weather side. Hornblower exulted both in their excitement and in their silence. “Send the hands to quarters as soon as they have breakfasted, Mr. I want the longboat and launch ready to be hoisted out at a moment’s notice. ” The hands came tumbling up from breakfast in a perfect babble of sound—the order to clear for action, the tricolour at the peak, the mountains of Spain ahead, the morning’s capture, all combining to work them up into wild excitement. “Keep those men silent on the main deck, there!” bellowed Hornblower. ” The noise dwindled abruptly, the men creeping about like children in a house with an irascible father. The bulkheads came down, the galley fire was tipped overside.',\n",
       " 'The boys were running up with powder for the guns; the shot garlands between the guns were filled with the black iron spheres ready for instant use. “Captain Morris, if I send away the longboat and launch, I want twenty marines in each. ” Hornblower took his glass and studied once more the rapidly nearing coast line. There were cliffs here, and the coast road wound at the foot of them, at the water’s edge, and the shore was steep–to, according to his charts. But it would be a sensible precaution to start the lead going soon. He was taking a risk in approaching a lee shore guarded by heavy batteries—the Sutherland might be badly knocked about before she could beat to windward out of range again. Hornblower was counting not merely on the disguise he had adopted, but on the very fact that the French would not believe that an English ship could take that risk.',\n",
       " 'To the French in the batteries the presence of a French ship of the line off that coast was susceptible of explanation—she might have ventured forth from Toulon, or have come in from the Atlantic, or she might be a refugee from some Ionian island attacked by the British, seeking refuge after long wanderings. He could not believe that they would open fire without allowing time for explanation. At a word from Hornblower the Sutherland turned on a course parallel with the shore, heading northward with the wind abeam. She was creeping along now, in the light breeze, only just out of gunshot of the shore. The sun was blazing down upon them, the crew standing silently at their stations, the officers grouped on the quarterdeck, Hornblower with the sweat running down his face, sweeping the coast with his glass in search of an objective.',\n",
       " 'The little wind was calling forth only the faintest piping from the rigging; the rattle of the blocks to the gentle roll of the ship sounded unnaturally loud in the silence as did the monotonous calling of the man at the lead. “There’s a lot of small craft, sir, at anchor round the point, there. ” A dark speck danced in the object glass of Hornblower’s telescope. He lowered the instrument to rest his aching eye, and then raised it again. The speck was still there; it was a tricolour flag waving lazily in the wind from a flagstaff on the point. Forty–two–pounders, probably, sited with a good command, probably with furnaces for heating the shot—no ship that floated could fight them. Clustered underneath, a little coasting fleet, huddling there for shelter at the sight of a strange sail. “Tell your men to lie down,” said Hornblower to Morris. He did not want the red coats of the marines drawn up on the quarterdeck to reveal his ship prematurely for what she was.',\n",
       " 'The Sutherland crept along, the grey cliffs growing more clearly defined as at Hornblower’s order she was edged closer inshore. Beyond the cliffs mountain peaks were revealing themselves with startling suddenness whenever Hornblower’s rigid concentration on the battery relaxed. He could see the parapets now in his glass, and he almost thought he could see the big guns peeping over them. At any moment now the battery might burst into thunder and flame and smoke, and in that case he would have to turn and fly, baffled. Perhaps the French had guessed the Sutherland’s identity, and were merely waiting to have her well within range. Every minute that the Sutherland approached meant another minute under fire when she tried to escape. The loss of a mast might mean in the end the loss of the ship. Vincent,” said Hornblower, without shifting his gaze from the battery. ” The words sent a stir through the group of officers. They could be certain now of what plan Hornblower had in mind.',\n",
       " 'The trick increased the risk of detection at the same time as, if it were successful, it gave them more opportunity of approaching the battery. If MV were the French recognition signal, and was being correctly employed, well and good. Hornblower, his heart thumping in his breast, judged that at any rate it might confuse the issue for the officer in the battery and induce him to delay a little longer. The signal rose up the halliards, and the battery still stayed silent. Now a signal hoist soared up the battery’s flagstaff. ” But the mere fact of the battery’s signalling in reply meant that they were at least doubtful of the Sutherland’s identity—unless it were part of the plan to lure her closer in. Yet if the battery delayed much longer it would be too late. Rayner will take the launch, and you will land and storm the battery.',\n",
       " '” “Quarter less eight,” droned the leadsman—Hornblower had listened to each cast subconsciously; now that the water was shoaling he was compelled to give half his attention up to the leadsman’s cries while still scrutinising the battery. A bare quarter of a mile from it now; it was time to strike. The shrilling of the pipes brought the boats’ crews to the falls at the run. This was the time when the painful drill would reveal its worth; the more quickly those boats were swung out, manned, and away, the less would be the danger and the greater the chance of success. Longboat and launch dropped to the water, the hands swarming down the falls. ” They were off, the men tugging like maniacs at the oars. Ah!” The air was torn with the passage of cannon shot overhead. The whole ship shook as something struck her a tremendous blow forward. Hornblower saw the smoke billow up round the battery—it had opened fire at last.',\n",
       " 'And thank God it was firing at the ship; if one of those shots hit a boat he would be in a pretty scrape. So pleased was he at the thought that it never occurred to him to wonder about his own personal safety. ” Another salvo from the battery, and too high again, the shots howling overhead. Little Longley, strutting the quarterdeck with his dirk at his hip, checked in his stride to duck, instinctively, and then, with a side glance at his captain, walked on with his neck as stiff as a ramrod. Longley, have that main topgallant halliard spliced at once. ” It was a kindness to keep the boy busy so that he would have no time to be afraid. Now the Sutherland’s starboard broadside began to open fire, irregularly, as the gun captains fancied their weapons bore. Flying jets of dust from the face of the cliff showed that most of the shots were hitting thirty feet too low.',\n",
       " 'But if even one or two shots got in through the embrasures and killed someone working the guns it would be a valuable help in unsettling the artillery men. The launch almost vanished under the jets of water flung up by the plunging fire, and Hornblower gulped with anxiety. But next moment the launch reappeared, limping along crabwise—a shot must have smashed some of the oars on one side. But the boats were safe now; close up to the cliffs as they were the guns above could surely not be depressed sufficiently to hit them. The longboat was in the very surf now, with the launch at her heels. Now the men were tumbling out and splashing up to the beach. For a moment Hornblower wished that, contrary to etiquette, he had taken command of the landing party, fearing lest a disorderly and piecemeal attack should waste all the advantages gained. He could see him through his glass, leaping up onto the road and then turning to face the landing party.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower could see Bush’s arms wave as he gave his orders. Someone led off a party of seamen to the right—that was Rayner, for Hornblower’s straining eyes could perceive his bald head and unmistakable round–shouldered gait. Morris was taking the marines—a solid block of scarlet—off to the left. Bush was forming up the remainder in the centre—Bush was clearheaded enough. There were three gullies in the face of the cliff, marked with straggling greenery, and indicating the easiest points of ascent. As the flanking parties reached the bottom of their paths, Hornblower saw Bush’s sword flash as he called his men on. They were breasting the cliffs now, all three parties simultaneously. A tiny faint cheer crept out over the water to the ship. One or two of the main–deck guns were making better practice now. Twice Hornblower thought he saw earth flying from the embrasures as shots struck them; so much the better, but the firing must stop now that the men were mounting the cliff.',\n",
       " 'In dead silence the ship slid on through the water while every eye watched the landing party. Sudden gusts of smoke showed that the guns were firing again—canister or grape, probably. Any of those parties caught in a whirlwind of canister from a forty–two–pounder might well be wiped out. Weapons were sparkling on the parapet; little pin pricks of smoke indicated small–arm fire. Now out on the left the red coats of the marines were on the very top of the parapet, and a white–clad sailor was waving from the centre. They were pouring over, although red dots and white dots littered the face of the parapet to mark where men had fallen. One anxious minute with nothing to see seemed to last for hours. And then the tricolour flag came slowly down its staff, and the hands on the main deck burst into a storm of cheering. Send in the quarter boats to take possession of the craft in the bay.',\n",
       " '” There were four tartans, a felucca, and two cutter–rigged boats clustered at anchor in the tiny bay below the battery—a fine haul, especially if they were fully laden. Hornblower saw the dinghies pulling madly from them for the shore on the side away from the battery, as the crews fled to escape captivity. Hornblower was glad to see them go; he did not want to be burdened with prisoners, and he had been a prisoner himself for two weary years in Ferrol. Something fell in an avalanche down the cliff, crashing onto the road at its foot in a cloud of dust and debris. It was a forty–two–pounder heaved up by brute force over the parapet; Bush had got to work quickly enough at dismantling the battery—if Bush were still alive. Another gun followed at an interval, and another after that.',\n",
       " 'The small craft, two of them towing the quarter boats, were beating out towards the Sutherland where she lay hove to awaiting them, and the landing party was coming down the cliff face again and forming up on the beach. Lingering groups indicated that the wounded were being brought down. All these necessary delays seemed to stretch the anticlimax into an eternity. A bellowing roar from the battery, and a fountain of earth and smoke—momentarily like those volcanoes at whose foot the Lydia had anchored last commission—told that the magazine had been fired. Now at last the launch and longboat were pulling back to the ship, and Hornblower’s telescope, trained on the stern sheets of the longboat, revealed Bush sitting there, alive and apparently well. Even then, it was a relief to see him come rolling aft, his big craggy face wreathed in smiles, to make his report. “The Frogs bolted out of the back door as we came in at the front,” he said.',\n",
       " 'We lost——” Hornblower had to nerve himself to listen to the pitiful list. Now that the excitement was over he felt weak and ill, and it was only by an effort that he was able to keep his hands from trembling. And it was only by an effort that he could make himself smile and mouth out words of commendation first to the men whom Bush singled out for special mention and then to the whole crew drawn up on the main deck. For hours he had been walking the quarterdeck pretending to be imperturbable, and now he was in the throes of the reaction. He left it to Bush to deal with the prizes, to allot them skeleton crews and send them off to Port Mahon, while without a word of excuse he escaped below to his cabin. He had even forgotten that the ship had been cleared for action, so that in his search for privacy he had to sit in his hammock chair at the end of the stern gallery, just out of sight from the stern windows, while the men were replacing the bulkheads and securing the guns.',\n",
       " 'He lay back, his arms hanging and his eyes closed, with the water bubbling under the counter below him and the rudder pintles groaning at his side. Each time the ship went about as Bush worked her out to make an offing his head sagged over to the opposite shoulder. What affected him most was the memory of the risks he had run; at the thought of them little cold waves ran down his back and his legs. He had been horribly reckless in his handling of the ship—only by the greatest good fortune was she not now a dismasted wreck, with half her crew killed and wounded, drifting onto a lee shore with an exultant enemy awaiting her. It was Hornblower’s nature to discount his achievements to himself, to make no allowance for the careful precautions he had taken to ensure success, for his ingenuity in making the best of circumstances. He cursed himself for a reckless fool, and for his habit of plunging into danger and only counting the risk afterwards.',\n",
       " 'A rattle of cutlery and crockery in the cabin recalled him to himself, and he sat up and resumed his unmoved countenance just in time as Polwheal came out into the stern gallery. ” Hornblower suddenly knew that he was horribly hungry, and at the same time he realised that he had forgotten the coffee Polwheal had brought him, hours ago, to the quarterdeck. Presumably that had stayed there to grow cold until Polwheal fetched it away. With real pleasure he got up and walked into the cabin; so tempting was the prospect of food and drink that he felt hardly a twinge of irritation at having Polwheal thus fussing over him and trying to mother him and probably getting ready to take overmuch advantage of his position.',\n",
       " 'The cold tongue was delicious, and Polwheal with uncanny intuition had put out a half bottle of claret—not one day a month did Hornblower drink anything stronger than water when by himself, yet today he drank three glasses of claret, knowing that he wanted them, and enjoying every drop. And as the food and the wine strengthened him, and his fatigue dropped away, his mind began to busy itself with new plans, devising, without his conscious volition, fresh methods of harassing the enemy. As he drank his coffee the ideas began to stir within him, and yet he was not conscious of them. All he knew was the cabin was suddenly stuffy and cramped, and that he was yearning again for the fresh air and fierce sunshine outside.',\n",
       " 'Polwheal, returning to clear the table, saw his captain through the stern windows pacing the gallery, and years of service under Hornblower had taught him to make the correct deductions from Hornblower’s bent, thoughtful head, and the hands which, although clasped behind him, yet twisted and turned one within the other as he worked out each prospective development. In consequence of what Polwheal had to tell, the lower deck all knew that another move was imminent, fully two hours before Hornblower appeared on the quarterdeck and gave the orders which precipitated it.',\n",
       " 'Chapter XI “THEY’RE SHOOTING well, sir,” said Bush, as a fountain of water leaped suddenly and mysteriously into brief life a hundred yards from the port beam. “Who couldn’t shoot well with their advantages?” answered Gerard. “Forty–two–pounders, on permanent mounts fifty feet above the water, and soldiers to serve ’em ten years in the ranks?” “I’ve seen ’em shoot worse, all the same,” said Crystal. And I shall want Rayner and Hooker—pass the word, there, for Mr. ” A dozen telescopes trained on Port Vendres, with the sunset reddening behind. In the background Mount Canigou stood out with a startling illusion of towering height; to the left the spurs of the Pyrenees ran clean down into the sea at Cape Cerbera, marking where Spain had ended and France begun. In the centre the white houses of Port Vendres showed pink under the sunset, clustering round the head of the little bay.',\n",
       " 'In front of them a vessel swung at anchor, under the protection of the batteries on either side of the bay which were marked by occasional puffs of smoke as the guns there tried repeatedly, at extreme long range, to hit this insolent ship which was flaunting British colours within sight of the Empire’s coasts. Rayner, you see the battery to the right—there goes a gun. Hooker, you see how the bay curves? You must be able to take a boat straight up to the ship there tonight. ” “Aye aye, sir,” said Hooker, while the other officers exchanged glances. ” Turning from one officer to another, Hornblower ran briefly through their instructions. The ship sheltering in Port Vendres was to be cut out and taken that night, as a climax to the twenty four hours which had begun with the capture of the Amelie and continued with the storming of the battery at Llanza. I shall take care to be back in our present position here at midnight,” said Hornblower.',\n",
       " 'With good fortune, the garrison of Port Vendres might be lured into tranquillity by the sight of the Sutherland sailing away now, and she could return unobserved after nightfall. An hour of darkness would suffice to effect a surprise, and the rising moon would give sufficient light for the captured ship to be brought out if successful, and for the attackers to rally and escape if unsuccessful. Bush will remain in command of the ship,” said Hornblower. “Please, sir——” “You’ve won sufficient distinction today, Mr. He knew that he would not be able to bear the anxiety of waiting outside with the firing and the fighting going on inside—he was in a fever already, now that he was allowing his mind to dwell on the prospective action, although he was taking care not to show it. “Every man in the boarding party must be a seaman,” said Hornblower. To set sail in a strange ship and get her under way in darkness would call for seamanship.',\n",
       " '“You all understand what is expected of you?” asked Hornblower, and they nodded again. He was a good officer, as Hornblower had known when he had recommended him for promotion to lieutenant on the Lydia’s return. “Then, gentlemen, you will please set your watches with mine. There will be enough light from the stars to read them. ” Hornblower could see, from his officers’ expressions, that this synchronisation of the watches had impressed upon them the necessity for accurately conforming to the time–table which he had laid down, in a fashion nothing else could have done. Otherwise they would have paid only casual attention to the intervals of “five minutes” and “ten minutes” which he had given, and he could appreciate in a manner they could not the necessity for exact adherence to schedule in a complex operation carried out in the darkness.',\n",
       " '“You are all agreed now? Then perhaps all you gentlemen with the exception of the officer of the watch will give me the pleasure of your company at dinner. ” Again the officers interchanged glances; those dinners in Hornblower’s cabin on the eve of action were famous. Savage could remember one on board the Lydia before the duel with the Natividad. The other two present then had been Galbraith, the lieutenant of his division, and Clay, his best friend. And Galbraith had died of gangrene in the far Pacific, and Clay’s head had been smashed by a cannon ball. “There’ll be no whist tonight, Savage,” smiled Hornblower, reading his thoughts. ” Often before Hornblower had insisted on whist before action, and had concealed his own nervousness by criticism of the play of his preoccupied fellow players. Now he was forcing himself to be smiling, genial, and hospitable as he led the way into the cabin.',\n",
       " 'His nervous tension inclined to make him talkative, and this evening, when his guests were more tongue–tied even than usual, he could for once give rein to his inclinations, and chat freely in an attempt to keep conversation going. The others eyed him wondering as he smiled and gossiped. They never saw him in this mood except on the eve of action, and they had forgotten how human and fascinating he could be when he employed all his wiles to captivate them. For him it was a convenient way to keep his mind off the approaching action, thus to exercise himself in fascination while still drawing the rigid line which divided the captain from his subordinates. “I am afraid,” said Hornblower in the end, crumpling his napkin and tossing it onto the table, “it is time for us to go on deck again, gentlemen. What a mortal pity to break up this gathering!” They left the lamp–lit brilliance of the cabin for the darkness of the deck.',\n",
       " 'The stars were glowing in the dark sky, and the Sutherland was stealing ghostlike over the sea which reflected them; her pyramids of canvas soared up to invisibility, and the only sounds to be heard were the rattle of the rigging and the periodic music of the water under her forefoot as she rode over the tiny invisible waves. The crew was resting on the gangways and the main deck, conversing in whispers, and when the subdued voices of their officers called them to duty they mustered silently, each division assembling for its particular duty. Hornblower checked the position of the ship with Bush, and strained his eye through his night glass towards the invisible shore. “Launch crew here!” echoed Rayner, and their allotted parties formed up quietly abreast of the mainmast.',\n",
       " 'The cutters’ crews were assembling on the quarterdeck; Hornblower was taking two hundred and fifty men altogether—if the expedition were a complete disaster Bush would hardly have sufficient men to navigate the Sutherland back to the rendezvous. One by one the boats were hoisted out, and lay on their oars a few yards off. Last of all, Hornblower went down the side and seated himself beside Brown and Longley in the stern of the barge; the men at the oars pushed off at a growl from Brown, and the flotilla, with muffled oars, began to pull steadily away from the ship. The darkness was intense, and, by the usual optical illusion, seemed still more intense close to the surface of the sea than up on the deck of the Sutherland. Slowly the barge drew ahead, and as the longboat and launch diverged out on each quarter they were rapidly lost to sight. The oars seemed to touch the velvety blackness of the sea without a sound.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower made himself sit still, his hand resting on the hilt of his fifty–guinea sword. He wanted to crane his neck round and look at the other boats; with every minute’s inaction he grew more nervous. Some fool of a marine might fiddle with the lock of his musket, or someone’s pistol, carelessly left at full cock, might go off as its owner tugged at his oar. The slightest warning given on shore would ruin the whole attack; might mean the loss of hundreds of lives, and call down upon his head—if he survived—a withering rebuke from his admiral. Grimly he made himself sit still for five more minutes before taking up his night glass. Then at last he caught the faintest possible glimpse of grey cliff. With his hand on the tiller he altered course until they were almost in the mouth of the inlet. “Easy!” he breathed, and the boat glided silently forward under the stars. Close astern two tiny nuclei of greater darkness indicated where the two cutters rested on their oars.',\n",
       " 'Holding his watch under his nose he could just see the time—he must wait three full minutes. A distant sound reached his ear; there were oars pulling in the harbour. He heard them splashing two hundred yards ahead; he fancied he could even see the splashes. The French were, as he expected, rowing guard round their precious ship. Yet her captain had not realised that a guard boat rowing with muffled oars, creeping very slowly along, would be a far more dangerous obstacle to a cutting–out expedition than any boat merely busily rowing up and down across the entrance. “Oars,” he whispered, and the men braced themselves ready to pull. If any man fires before I do I’ll shoot him with my own hand. Give way!” The barge crept forward again, stealing into the harbour.',\n",
       " 'In a few more seconds she would be at the point where the batteries’ fire crossed, the point which sentries would have under constant observation, upon which the guns would be laid at nightfall so that a salvo would blow any approaching boat out of the water. For a horrible second Hornblower wondered whether launch and longboat had gone astray. A loud challenge on his right, heard clearly across the water, followed by another on his left, and both instantly drowned in a wild rattle of musketry fire. Rayner and Gerard were leading their parties against the batteries, and both of them, as their orders had dictated, were making an infernal noise about it so as to distract the gunners at the vital moment. His eye caught the splashes of the guard boat’s oars, more noticeable than ever with the crew pulling wildly as they paid attention to the din on shore instead of to their own business. The barge shot silently and unnoticeably towards it.',\n",
       " 'She was only fifty yards from the guard boat when someone at last caught sight of her. “Qui va là?” cried someone, sharply, but before any answer could be expected the barge came crashing up against the guard boat’s side, as Hornblower dragged the tiller round. His quick order had got the oars in a second before the collision, while the impact of the barge swept the oars of the guard boat away, tumbling half her crew in a tangle into the bottom of the boat. Hornblower’s sword was out, and at the instant of contact he leaped madly from the barge to the guard boat, choking with excitement and nervousness as he did so. He landed with both feet on someone in the stern, trod him down, and miraculously kept his own footing. There was a white face visible down by his knee, and he kicked at it, wildly, felt a jar up his leg as the kick went home, and at the same moment he cut with all his strength at another head before him.',\n",
       " 'He felt the sword bite into bone; the boat rolled frightfully under him as more of the barge’s crew came tumbling into the guard boat. Someone was heaving himself upright before him—someone with a black gash of a moustache across his face in the starlight, and therefore no Englishman. Hornblower lunged fiercely as he reeled in the rocking boat, and he and his opponent came down together upon the men under their feet. When he scrambled up the struggle was over, without a shot being fired. The guard boat’s crew was dead, or overboard, or knocked unconscious. Hornblower felt his neck and his wrist wet and sticky—with blood, presumably, but he did not have time to think about that. ” The whole fight had hardly taken more than a few seconds. At the batteries the racket of the attack was still continuing, and even as the barge pushed away from the derelict guard boat there came a sudden splutter of musketry fire from higher up the bay.',\n",
       " 'The two cutters had reached the anchored ship without impediment, rowing, as Hornblower’s orders had dictated, past the two locked boats straight for her. With his hand on the tiller he set a course for the musket flashes. Apparently the cutter’s crews had not succeeded in carrying the ship at the first rush, for the sparkle of the firing stayed steady along the ship’s bulwark—she must have had her boarding nettings rigged and her crew fairly wide awake. The child Longley at his side was leaping about in his seat with excitement. He put the tiller over and the barge swept under the ship’s stern towards the disengaged side of the ship. ” It was a hard scramble up the side of the ship, and her boarding nettings were rigged, sure enough. Hornblower found foothold on the bulwark through the netting, swaying perilously, leaning far out over the water, for the nettings were rigged from the yard–arms and sloped sharply outwards.',\n",
       " 'The boy had his dirk between his teeth in the fashion he had heard about in sailors’ yarns. He looked so foolish hanging in the netting with the great clumsy weapon in his mouth that Hornblower giggled insanely on his insecure foothold. He snatched his sword from his sheath, clutching with the other hand, and slashed at the tarry cordage. The whole net was heaving and tossing as the barge’s crew wrenched at it; he was almost jerked from his hold. This surprise attack on the unguarded side must be shaking the nerve of the defenders trying to beat off the cutters’ crews. The fifty–guinea sword was of the finest steel and had a razor edge; it was cutting through strand after strand of the netting. For one horrible second Hornblower lost his footing and nearly fell outwards, but with a convulsive effort he recovered and swung himself forward, falling through the net on his hands and knees, the sword clattering on the deck before him.',\n",
       " 'A Frenchman was rushing at him; his eye caught a glimpse of the steel head of a levelled pike. He snatched hold of the shaft, twisting onto his back, guiding the weapon clear. The Frenchman’s knee crashed into the back of his head, and his neck was badly wrenched as the Frenchman tumbled over on top of him. He kicked himself clear, found his sword, miraculously, and stood to face the other dark shapes rushing at him. A pistol banged off at his ear, half deafening him, and it seemed as if the whole mass of those attacking him melted away into nothing at the flash. Those others crossing the deck now were English; they were cheering. Boats might come dashing out from the shore with reinforcements for the ship’s crew; and Rayner and Gerard might be repulsed by the garrisons of the batteries so that he would have to run the gantlet of the guns. ” The rocket which Brown had brought with him at Hornblower’s orders was to be the signal to the landing parties that the ship was taken.',\n",
       " 'And there was a decided breath of air coming off the land which would carry the ship out of the bay; Hornblower had counted on that—after the scorching heat of the day a land breeze was only to be expected. Hooker had loosed the main topsail, and the ship was already gathering sternway. “Hands to the braces, there, barge’s crew, first cutter’s crew. ” Brown’s flint and steel were clicking and flashing as he crouched on the deck. The rocket rose in an upward torrent of sparks and burst high above into stars. As the fore staysail was set the ship’s head came round, and as she steadied on her course down the bay with the wind abaft the moon cleared the horizon right ahead—a gibbous, waning moon, giving just enough light for Hornblower to be able to con the ship easily out of the bay between the batteries. Hornblower could hear whistles blowing, piercing the sound of the musketry which was still popping round the batteries.',\n",
       " 'Two splashes overside indicated that a couple of the ship’s crew were swimming for the shore rather than face captivity.',\n",
       " 'Chapter XII THIS GULF of the Lion was not likely to be a very profitable cruising ground, so Hornblower decided as he scanned the French coast through his telescope. It was so deeply embayed that any wind from north to west through south would find his ship with land under her lee; it was shallow, treacherous, and liable to be whipped by storms into a tremendous sea. Navigational risks were worth taking if a suitable prize offered, but, thought Hornblower looking at the coast, there was small chance of any prize. From Port Vendres as far round as Marseilles—the limit of the Inshore Squadron’s sector—the flat shore was bordered by vast dreary lagoons which were separated from the sea by long spits of sand and even by peninsulas of cultivated land.',\n",
       " 'There were batteries here and there upon the sand spits, and regular forts to support them, and the little towns, Cette, Aigues–Mortes, and so on, were encompassed by mediæval fortifications which could defy any effort he could make against them. But the main factor was that chain of lagoons, linked together since Roman times by a series of canals. Vessels up to two hundred tons could creep along inside the coast line—he could actually see through his glass, at this very moment, brown sails apparently sailing over the green vineyards. The entrances to the chain were all defended by solid works, and if he were to try to surprise one of these it would involve running all the risk of taking his ship in through the tortuous channels between the sand banks, under gunfire. Even if he should succeed he could still hardly attack the shipping in the lagoons.',\n",
       " 'The blue Mediterranean under the glaring blue sky shaded to green and even to yellow as it shoaled here and there in patches, a constant reminder to Hornblower as he walked his deck of the treacherous water he was navigating. Bush, watch in hand, had fifty men whom he was drilling aloft—they had set and furled the fore–topgallant sail a dozen times in the last hour and a half, which must be puzzling the numerous telescopes trained on the ship from the shore. Harrison the boatswain, down on the main deck, was squatting on a stool with two of his mates and twenty landsmen cross–legged in a ring round him—he was teaching the advanced class some of the refinements of knotting and splicing. From the lower gun deck the squeal and rumble of gun trucks told how Gerard was exercising embryo gun layers at the six forward twenty–four–pounders—Gerard’s ambition was to have six trained gun captains at every gun, and he was a long way yet from achieving it.',\n",
       " 'On the poop Crystal with his sextant was patiently trying to instruct the midshipmen in the elements of navigation—the young devils were fidgety as Crystal droned on. He had delighted in mathematics since his boyhood; logarithms had been playthings to him at little Longley’s age, and a problem in spherical trigonometry was to him a source of pleasure, analogous, he realised, to the pleasure some of those lads found in the music which was so incomprehensible to him. A monotonous hammering below indicated that the carpenter and his mates were putting the finishing touches to their repair of the big hole which had been made yesterday morning—incredible that it was hardly more than twenty four hours ago—by the forty–two–pounder at Llanza, while the clanking of the pumps showed that the petty criminals of the ship were pumping her out.',\n",
       " 'The Sutherland, thanks to her recent docking, leaked extraordinarily little, less than an inch a day in calm weather, and Hornblower was able to deal with this small amount by an hour’s pumping every morning, allotting to it the miscreants who had found themselves in Bush’s or Harrison’s black books by being last up the hatchway, or lashing up their hammocks with four and a half turns, or by committing any of the numerous crimes of omission or commission which annoy boatswains and first lieutenants. A turn at pumping—the most monotonous and uninviting work in the ship—was a far more economical punishment than the cat, and Hornblower believed it to be more deterrent, rather to Bush’s amusement. Smoke was pouring from the galley chimney, and even on the quarterdeck Hornblower could smell the cooking that was going on.',\n",
       " 'The men were going to have a good dinner today, with duff; yesterday they had eaten and drunk nothing save biscuit and cold water, thanks to the ship having been engaged three times in twenty four hours. They did not mind that as long as they were successful—it was amazing how beneficial a little success was to discipline. Today, with eleven dead and sixteen wounded, with thirty four men away in prizes—less two prisoners who had elected to serve the King of England rather than face one of his prisons—the Sutherland was more effective as a fighting unit than the day before yesterday with practically a full complement. Hornblower could see, from the quarterdeck, the cheerfulness and high spirits of everyone in sight. He had forgotten his fears of yesterday, and three successful actions in a day had re–established his self–confidence. He was at least a thousand pounds the richer by his captures, and that was good to think about. He had never before in his life had a thousand pounds.',\n",
       " 'He remembered how Lady Barbara had tactfully looked away after a single glance at the pinchbeck buckles on his shoes. Next time he dined with Lady Barbara he would be wearing solid gold buckles, with diamonds set in them if he chose, and by some inconspicuous gesture he would call her attention to them. Maria would have bracelets and rings to flaunt his success before the eyes of the world. Hornblower remembered with pride that he had not known a moment’s fear last night in Port Vendres, not when he leaped on board the guard boat, not even when he had found himself in the nightmare embrace of the boarding netting. Just as he now had the wealth for which he had longed, so he had proved to himself to his own surprise that he possessed the brute physical courage which he had envied in his subordinates.',\n",
       " 'Even though, characteristically, he attached no importance to the moral courage and organising ability and ingenuity he had displayed, he was on the crest of a wave of optimism and self–confidence. With high spirits bubbling inside him he turned once more to scan the flat repulsive coast on his left hand, applying himself to the problem of how to stir up confusion there. Down below there were the captured French charts with which the Admiralty had supplied him—as they had the Pluto and Caligula as well, presumably. Hornblower spent the earliest hours of daylight in poring over them. He called up their details before his mind’s eye as he looked across the shallows at the green bar of coast, and the brown sails beyond. He was as close in as he dared, and yet that sail was half a mile beyond cannon shot. Over to the left was Cette, perched up on the top of a little hill prominent above the surrounding flat land.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower was reminded of Rye overlooking Romney Marsh, but Cette was a gloomy little town of a prevailing black colour, unlike Rye’s cheerful greys and reds. And Cette, he knew, was a walled town, with a garrison, against which he could attempt nothing. Behind Cette was the big lagoon called the Etang de Thau, which constituted a major link in the chain of inland waterways which offered shelter and protection to French shipping all the way from Marseilles and the Rhone Valley to the foot of the Pyrenees. Cette was invulnerable as far as he was concerned, and vessels on the Etang de Thau were safe from him. Of all the whole inland route he was opposite the most vulnerable part, this short section where the navigable channel from Aigues–Mortes to the Etang de Thau was only divided from the sea by a narrow spit of land.',\n",
       " 'If a blow were to be struck, it was here that he must strike it; moreover, at this very moment he could see something at which to strike—that brown sail no more than two miles away. That must be one of the French coasters, plying between Port Vendres and Marseilles with wine and oil. It would be madness to attempt anything against her, and yet—and yet—he felt mad today. “Pass the word for the captain’s coxswain,” he said to the midshipman of the watch. He heard the cry echo down the main deck, and in two minutes Brown was scurrying towards him along the gangway, halting breathless for orders. ” Hornblower looked at Brown’s burly shoulders and thick neck. There was a mat of black hair visible through the opening of his shirt. “How many of the barge’s crew can swim?” Brown looked first one way and then the other before he made the confession which he knew would excite contempt. ” Hornblower refraining from the obvious rejoinder was more scathing than Hornblower saying “You ought to know.',\n",
       " 'It’s for a dangerous service, and, mark you, Brown, they must be true volunteers—none of your press–gang ways. ” “Aye aye, sir,” said Brown, and after a moment’s hesitation, “Everyone’ll volunteer, sir. A couple of port–fires, oily rags, and a bit of slow match, in a watertight packet for each man. Ask him to step this way, and then get your crew ready. ” Bush came rolling aft, his face alight with excitement; and before he had reached the quarterdeck the ship was abuzz with rumours—the wildest tales about what the captain had decided to do next were circulating among the crew, who had spent the morning with one eye on their duties and the other on the coast of France. Bush,” said Hornblower, “I am going ashore to burn that coaster over there. Are you going in person, sir?” “Yes,” snapped Hornblower. He could not explain to Bush that he was constitutionally unable to send men away on a task for which volunteers were necessary and not go himself.',\n",
       " 'He eyed Bush defiantly, and Bush eyed him back, opened his mouth to protest, thought better of it, and changed what he was going to say. ” That was obvious; four successive lines of foam showed where the feeble waves were breaking, far out from the water’s edge. ” Still Hornblower, by his expression, dared Bush to make any protest at all, but this time Bush actually ventured to make one. ” There was no chance of further dispute in the face of that blank negative. Bush had the queer feeling—he had known it before—as he looked at Hornblower’s haughty expression, that he was a father dealing with a high–spirited son; he loved his captain as he would have loved a son if ever he had had one. You understand? Shall I give you that in writing?” “No need, sir. When it came to the supreme test of practice, Hornblower, however much he respected Bush’s qualities and abilities, had no opinion whatever of his first lieutenant’s capacity to make original plans.',\n",
       " 'The thought of Bush blundering about on the mainland of France throwing away valuable lives in a hopeless attempt to rescue his captain frightened him. ” The barge pulled eight oars; as Hornblower gave the word he had high hopes that her launching had passed unobserved from the shore. Bush’s morning sail drill must have accustomed the French to seemingly purposeless manœuvres by the Sutherland; her brief backing of her topsails might be unnoticed. He sat at Brown’s side while the men bent to their oars. The boat danced quickly and lightly over the sea; he set a course so as to reach the shore a little ahead of the brown sail which was showing just over the green strip of coast. Then he looked back at the Sutherland, stately under her pyramids of sails, and dwindling with extraordinary rapidity as the barge shot away from her. Even at that moment Hornblower’s busy mind set to work scanning her lines and the rake of her masts, debating how he could improve her sailing qualities.',\n",
       " 'They had passed the first line of breakers without taking ground—breakers they could hardly be called, so sluggish was the sea—and darted in towards the golden beach. A moment later the boat balked as she slid over the sand, moved on a few yards, and grounded once more. He threw his legs over the side and dropped thigh–deep into the water. The crew were as quick as he, and seizing the gunwales, they ran the lightened boat up until the water was no higher than their ankles. Hornblower’s first instinct was to allow excitement to carry him away and head a wild rush inland, but he checked himself. “Fire packets?” Running his eye over his nine men he saw that every one was armed and equipped, and then he started his little expedition steadily up the beach. The distance was too great to expect them to run all the way and swim afterwards. The sandy beach was topped by a low shingle bank where samphire grew.',\n",
       " 'They leaped over this and found themselves among green vines; not twenty yards away an old, bent man and two old women were hoeing along the rows. They looked up in blank surprise at this sudden apparition, standing and staring voiceless at the chattering group of seamen. A quarter of a mile away, across the level vineyard, was the brown spritsail. Hornblower picked out a narrow path leading roughly in that direction. “Come along, men,” he said, and broke into a dog trot. The old man shouted something as the seamen trampled the vines; they laughed like children at hearing French spoken for the first time in their lives. To most of them this was their first sight of a vineyard, too—Hornblower could hear them chattering behind him in amazement at the orderly rows of seemingly worthless stumps, and the tiny bunches of immature grapes. They crossed the vineyard; a sharp drop on the farther side brought them onto a rough towpath along the canal.',\n",
       " 'Here the lagoon was no more than two hundred yards wide, and the navigable channel was evidently close up to the towpath, for a sparse line of beacons a hundred yards out presumably marked the shallows. Two hundred yards away the coaster was creeping slowly towards them, still unconscious of her danger. The men uttered a wild cheer and began tearing off their jackets. He unbuckled his sword belt and stripped off his coat. At the sound of the men’s shouting the crew of the coaster came tumbling forward. There were three men, and a moment later they were joined by two sturdy women, looking at them from under their hands. It was one of the women, quicker witted, who guessed what the group of men stripping on the bank implied. Hornblower, tearing off his breeches, heard one of them give a shriek and saw her running aft again.',\n",
       " 'The coaster still crept over the water towards them, but when it was nearly opposite the big spritsail came down with a run and she swung away from the towpath as her helm was put over. She passed through the line of beacons and grounded with a jerk in the shallows beyond. Hornblower saw the man at the wheel quit his charge and turn and stare at them, with the other men and the women grouped round them. Brown was naked, too, and was fastening his belt round his waist, and against his bare skin lay a naked cutlass. “Come along, men,” said Hornblower; the quicker the better. He put his hands together and dropped into the lagoon in an ungainly dive; the men followed him, shouting and splashing. The water was as warm as milk, but Hornblower swam as slowly and as steadily as he could. He was a poor swimmer, and the coaster a hundred and fifty yards away seemed very distant. The sword dangling from his waist already seemed heavy.',\n",
       " 'Brown came surging past him, swimming a lusty overarm stroke, with the lanyard of his packet of combustibles between his white teeth, and his thick black hair sleek with water. The other men followed; by the time they neared the coaster Hornblower was a long way last. They all scrambled up before him into the low waist of the vessel, but then discipline reasserted itself and they turned and stooped to haul him on board. Women and men were there in a sullen group, and for a moment he was puzzled to know what to do with them. French and English faced each other in the dazzling sunlight, the water streaming from the naked men, but in the tenseness of that meeting no one thought of the nakedness. Hornblower remembered with relief the dinghy towing behind; he pointed to it and tried to remember his French. There were four middle–aged men and one old one; one old woman and one middle–aged. The English seamen closed up behind their captain, drawing their cutlasses from their belts.',\n",
       " '” The middle–aged woman broke into a storm of invective, screeching, high–pitched, her hands gesticulating wildly and her wooden shoes clattering on the deck. ” He took one of the men by the collar, flourished his cutlass and dragged him across the deck to the side. The man yielded, and lowered himself over the side, and, once the example was set, the others followed it. Brown cast off the painter and the crowded dinghy drifted away, the woman still shrieking curses in her Catalan French. “Brown, take three men below and see what you can do there. ” The late crew had got out a couple of oars and were paddling cautiously over to the towpath, the dinghy laden down to within an inch of the water’s edge. Hornblower watched them as they crawled across, and climbed the bank to the path. A mighty crashing from below showed that Brown’s party was bursting into the cargo to make a nest for a fire.',\n",
       " 'Smoke emerged almost at once from the cabin skylight; one of the men had piled the furniture there together, soused it in oil from the lamps, and got the whole thing into a blaze at once. “Cargo is oil in barr’ls and grain in sacks, sir,” reported Brown. “We stove in some barr’ls an’ ripped some sacks open, sir. ” From the main hatchway a thin ghost of black smoke was already rising, and the heat pouring up from the hatch made all the forward part of the ship appear to dance and shimmer in the sunshine. There was a fire in the dry timberwork of the deck just forward of the hatch, too. It was crackling and banging explosively, although this fire was hardly visible thanks to the strong sunlight and the absence of smoke, and there was fire in the forecastle—smoke was billowing out of the bulkhead door and rolling towards them in a sullen wave. “Get some of the deck planks up,” said Hornblower, hoarsely.',\n",
       " 'The splintering crash of the work was followed by a contrasting silence—and yet no silence, for Hornblower’s ear caught a muffled, continuous roaring. It was the noise of the flames devouring the cargo, as the increased draught caused by the piercing of the decks set the flames racing through the inflammable stuff. The whole waist of the ship seemed to open as the fire poured up through the deck. ” He set the example by diving once more into the lagoon, and the little naked band began to swim slowly back to the towpath. Slowly, this time; the high spirits of the attack had evaporated. The awful sight of the red fire glowing under the deck had sobered every man. They swam slowly, clustered round their captain, while he set a pace limited by his fatigue and unscientific breaststroke. He was glad when he was able at last to stretch out a hand and grasp the weeds growing on the towpath bank. The others scrambled out before him; Brown offered him a wet hand and helped him up to the top.',\n",
       " '“Will ye look at th’ old bitch?” They were thirty yards from where they had left their clothes, and at that spot the coaster’s crew had landed. At the moment when the Irishman called their attention to them the old woman who had reviled them cast one last garment into the lagoon. One or two derelict shirts still floated in the lagoon, buoyed up by the air they contained, but practically all their clothes were at the bottom. “What did you do that for, damn you?” raved Brown—all the seamen had rushed up to the coaster’s crew and were dancing and gesticulating naked round them. It was ablaze from end to end, with heavy black smoke pouring from her sides. They saw the rigging of the mainmast whisk away in smouldering fragments, and the mast suddenly sag to one side, barely–visible flames licking along it. “I’ll get your shirt back for you, sir,” said one of the men to Hornblower, tearing himself free from the fascination of the sight.',\n",
       " '“Would you like the old man’s trousers, sir?” asked Brown. One last glance down showed that the two women were weeping, heartbroken, now. Hornblower saw one of the men patting one of the women on the shoulder; the others watched with despairing apathy the burning of their ship—their all. A horseman was galloping towards them; his blue uniform and cocked hat showed that he was one of Bonaparte’s gendarmes. He reined up in front of them, reaching for his sabre, but at the same time, not too sure of himself, he looked to right and to left for the help which was not in sight. “Ah, would you!” said Brown, dashing to the front waving his cutlass. The other seamen closed up beside him, their weapons ready, and the gendarme hastily wheeled his horse out of harm’s way; a gleam of white teeth showed under his black moustache.',\n",
       " 'They hurried past him; he had dismounted when Hornblower looked back, and was trying, as well as his restless horse would allow, to take his carbine out of the boot beside his saddle. At the top of the beach stood the old man and the two women who had been hoeing; the old man brandished his hoe and threatened them, but the two women stood smiling shamefaced, looking up under lowered eyelids at their nakedness. There lay the barge, just in the water, and far out there was the Sutherland—the men cheered at the sight of her. Lustily they ran the boat out over the sand, paused while Hornblower climbed in, pushed her out farther, and then came tumbling in over the side and took the oars. One man yelped with pain as a splinter in a thwart pricked his bare posterior; Hornblower grinned automatically, but the man was instantly reduced to silence by a shocked Brown. “’Ere ’e comes, sir,” said stroke oar, pointing aft over Hornblower’s shoulder.',\n",
       " 'The gendarme was leaping clumsily down the beach in his long boots, his carbine in his hand. Hornblower, craning round, saw him kneel and take aim; for a second Hornblower wondered, sickly, whether his career was going to be ended by the bullet of a French gendarme, but the puff of smoke from the carbine brought not even the sound of the bullet—a man who had ridden far, and run fast in heavy boots, could hardly be expected to hit a ship’s boat at two hundred yards with a single shot. Over the spit of land between sea and lagoon they could see a vast cloud of smoke. The coaster was destroyed beyond any chance of repair. It had been a wicked waste to destroy a fine ship like that, but war and waste were synonymous terms. It meant misery and poverty for the owners; but at the same time it would mean that the length of England’s arm had been demonstrated now to the people of this enemy land whom the war had not affected during these eighteen years save through Bonaparte’s conscription.',\n",
       " 'More than that; it meant that the authorities responsible for coast defence would be alarmed about this section of the route from Marseilles to Spain, the very section which they had thought safest. That would mean detaching troops and guns to defend it against future raids, stretching the available forces thinner still along the two hundred miles of coast. A thin screen of that sort could easily be pierced at a selected spot by a heavy blow struck without warning—the sort of blow a squadron of ships of the line, appearing and disappearing at will over the horizon, could easily strike. If the game were played properly, the whole coast from Barcelona to Marseilles could be kept in a constant state of alarm. That was the way to wear down the strength of the Corsican colossus; and a ship favoured by the weather could travel ten, fifteen times as fast as troops could march, as fast even as a well–mounted messenger could carry a warning.',\n",
       " 'He had struck at the French centre, he had struck at the French left wing. Now he must hasten and strike at the French right wing on his way back to the rendezvous. He uncrossed and recrossed his knees as he sat in the stern sheets of the barge, his desire for instant action filling him with restlessness while the boat drew closer to the Sutherland. He heard Gerard’s voice saying “What the devil—?” come clearly over the water to him; apparently Gerard had just detected the nakedness of everyone in the approaching boat. The pipes had twittered to call the watch’s attention to the arrival of the ship’s captain. He would have to come in naked through the entry port, receiving the salutes of the officers and marines, but keyed up as he was he gave no thought to his dignity. He ran up to the deck with his sword hanging from his naked waist—it was an ordeal which could not be avoided, and he had learned in twenty years in the Navy to accept the inevitable without lamentation.',\n",
       " 'The faces of the side boys and of the marines were wooden in their effort not to smile, but Hornblower did not care. The black pall of smoke over the land marked an achievement of which any man might be proud. He stayed naked on the deck until he had given Bush the order to put the ship about which would take the Sutherland southward again in search of fresh adventure. The wind would just serve for a southwesterly course, and he was not going to waste a minute of a favourable wind.',\n",
       " 'Chapter XIII THE Sutherland had seen nothing of the Caligula during her long sweep southwestward. Hornblower had not wanted to, and, more, had been anxious not to. For it was just possible that the Pluto had reached the rendezvous, and in that case the Admiral’s orders would override Captain Bolton’s, and he would be deprived of this further opportunity before his time limit had elapsed. It was during the hours of darkness that the Sutherland had crossed the latitude of Cape Bagur—the Palamos Point of the rendezvous—and morning found the Sutherland far to the southwestward, with the mountains of Catalonia a blue streak on the horizon over the starboard bow. Hornblower had been on deck since dawn, a full hour before the land was sighted; at his orders the ship wore round and stood close–hauled to the northeastward again, edging in to the shore as she did so until the details of the hilly country were plainly visible.',\n",
       " 'Bush was on deck, standing with a group of other officers; Hornblower, pacing up and down, was conscious of the glances they were darting at him, but he did his best not to notice them, as he kept his telescope steadily directed at the land. He knew that Bush and all the others thought he had come hither with a set purpose in mind, and that they were awaiting the orders which would plunge the ship again into the same kind of adventures which had punctuated the last two days. They credited him with diabolical foresight and ingenuity; he was not going to admit to them how great a part good fortune had played, nor was he going to admit that he had brought the Sutherland down here, close in to Barcelona, merely on general principles and in the hope that something might turn up.',\n",
       " 'It was stifling hot already; the blue sky glared with a brassy tint to the eastward, and the easterly breeze seemed not to have been cooled at all by its passage across four hundred miles of the Mediterranean from Italy. It was like breathing the air of a brick kiln; Hornblower found himself running with sweat within a quarter of an hour of cooling himself off under the wash–deck pump. The land slipping by along their larboard beam seemed to be devoid of all life. There were lofty grey–green hills, many of them capped with a flat table top of stone with precipitous rocky slopes; there were grey cliffs and brown cliffs, and occasional dazzling beaches of golden sand. Between the sea and those hills ran the most important highroad in Catalonia, that connecting Barcelona with France. Surely, thought Hornblower, something ought to show up somewhere along here. He knew there was a bad mountain road running parallel ten miles inland, but the French would hardly use it of their own free will.',\n",
       " 'One of the reasons why he had come here was to force them to abandon the highroad in favour of the byroad where the Spanish partisans would have a better chance of cutting up their convoys; he might achieve that merely by flaunting the British flag here within gunshot of the beach, but he would rather bring it about by administering a sharp lesson. He did not want this blow of his against the French right flank to be merely a blow in the air. The hands were skylarking and laughing as they washed the decks; it was comforting to see their high spirits, and peculiarly comforting to allow oneself to think that those high spirits were due to the recent successes. Hornblower felt a glow of achievement as he looked forward, and then, as was typical of him, began to feel doubts as to whether he could continue to keep his men in such good order. A long, dreary cruise on blockade service might soon wear down their spirits. Then he spurned away his doubts with determined optimism.',\n",
       " 'Everything had gone so well so far; it would continue to go well. This very day, even though the chances were a hundred to one against it, something was certain to happen. He told himself defiantly that the vein of good fortune was not yet exhausted. A hundred to one against or a thousand to one, something was going to happen again today, some further chance of distinction. On the shore over there was a little cluster of white cottages above a golden beach. And drawn up on the beach were a few boats—Spanish fishing boats, presumably. There would be no sense in risking a landing party, for there was always the chance that the village would have a French garrison. Those fishing boats would be used to supply fish to the French army, too, but he could do nothing against them, despite that.',\n",
       " 'The poor devils of fishermen had to live: if he were to capture or burn those boats he would set the people against the alliance with England—and it was only in the Peninsula, out of the whole world, that England had any allies. One of the fishing boats was being run out into the sea. Perhaps this was the beginning of today’s adventure; he felt hope, even certainty, springing up within him. He put his glass under his arm and turned away, walking the deck apparently deep in thought, his head bent and his hands clasped behind him. “Boat putting off from the shore, sir,” said Bush, touching his hat. He hoped that his officers believed that he had not yet seen the boat and was so strong–minded as not to step out of his way to look at her. “Yes,” said Hornblower, still apparently unconcerned.',\n",
       " 'It would be at least ten minutes before the boat could near the ship—and the boat must be intending to approach the Sutherland, or else why should she put off so hurriedly as soon as the Sutherland came in sight? The other officers could train their glasses on the boat, could chatter in loud speculation as to why she was approaching. Captain Hornblower could walk his deck in lofty indifference, awaiting the inevitable hail. No one save himself knew that his heart was beating faster. Now the hail came, high–pitched, across the glittering water. Bush,” said Hornblower, and stepped with elaborate calm to the other side to hail back. It was Catalan which was being shouted to him; his wide and exact knowledge of Spanish—during his two years as a prisoner on parole when a young man he had learned the language thoroughly to keep himself from fretting into insanity—and his rough and ready French enabled him to understand what was being spoken, but he could not speak Catalan.',\n",
       " '” At the sound of his voice someone else stood up in the boat. The men at the oars were Catalans in ragged civilian dress; this man wore a brilliant yellow uniform and a lofty hat with a plume. “May I be permitted to come on board?” he shouted in Spanish. ” “You will be very welcome,” said Hornblower, and then, turning to Bush, “A Spanish officer is coming on board, Mr. ” The man who stepped onto the deck and looked curiously about him, as the marines saluted and the pipes twittered, was obviously a hussar. He wore a yellow tunic elaborately frogged in black, and yellow breeches with broad stripes of gold braid. Up to his knees he wore shiny riding boots with dangling gold tassels in front and jingling spurs on the heels; a silver–grey coat trimmed with black astrakhan, its sleeves empty, was slung across his shoulders.',\n",
       " 'On his head was a hussar busby, of black astrakhan with a silver–grey bag hanging out of the top behind an ostrich plume, and gold cords from the back of it round his neck, and he trailed a broad curved sabre along the deck as he advanced to where Hornblower awaited him. “I am Colonel José Gonzales de Villena y Danvila, of His Most Catholic Majesty’s Olivenza Hussars. “And I am Captain Horatio Hornblower, of His Britannic Majesty’s ship Sutherland. ” “How fluently your excellency speaks Spanish!” “Your excellency is too kind. I am fortunate in my ability to speak Spanish, since it enables me to make you welcome on board my ship. It was only with difficulty that I was able to reach you. I had to exert all my authority to make those fishermen row me out. They were afraid lest the French should discover that they had been communicating with an English ship. ” “There is no French garrison in that village at present, then?” “No, sir, none.',\n",
       " '” A peculiar expression played over Villena’s face as he said this. He was a youngish man of fair complexion, though much sunburned, with a Hapsburg lip (which seemed to indicate that he might owe his high position in the Spanish army to some indiscretion on the part of one of his female ancestors) and hazel eyes with drooping lids. Those eyes met Hornblower’s without a hint of shiftiness. They merely seemed to be pleading with him not to continue his questioning, but Hornblower ignored the appeal—he was far too anxious for data. ” “But your regiment, Colonel?” “It is not there, Captain,” said Villena, and continued hastily. “The news I have to give you is that a French army—Italian, I should say—is marching along the coast road there, three leagues to the north of us. “They were at Malgret last night, on their way to Barcelona. Ten thousand of them—Pino’s and Lecchi’s divisions of the Italian army.',\n",
       " '” “How do you know this?” “It is my duty to know it, as an officer of light cavalry,” said Villena with dignity. For three years now, he knew, Bonaparte’s armies had been marching up and down the length and breadth of Catalonia. They had beaten the Spaniards in innumerable battles, had captured their fortresses after desperate sieges, and yet were no nearer subjecting the country than when they had first treacherously invaded the province. The Catalans had not been able to overcome in the field even the motley hordes Bonaparte had used on this side of Spain—Italians, Germans, Swiss, Poles, all the sweepings of his army—but at the same time they had fought on nobly, raising fresh forces in every unoccupied scrap of territory, and wearing out their opponents by the incessant marches and counter–marches they imposed on them.',\n",
       " 'Yet that did not explain how a Spanish colonel of hussars found himself quite alone near the heart of the Barcelona district where the French were supposed to be in full control. “How did you come to be there?” he demanded, sharply. “In accordance with my duty, sir,” said Villena, with lofty dignity. “I regret very much that I still do not understand, Don José. Where is your regiment?” “Captain——” “Where is it?” “I do not know, sir. ” All the jauntiness was gone from the young hussar now. He looked at Hornblower with big pleading eyes as he was made to confess his shame. They were on the march back from Gerona and we came down from the mountains to cut them off. ” The pitiful words enabled Hornblower to understand the whole story in a wave of intuition. Hornblower could visualise it all—the undisciplined hordes drawn up on some hillside, the mad charges which dashed them into fragments, and the helter–skelter flight.',\n",
       " 'In every village for miles round there would be lurking fugitives today. Villena had ridden his horse until it dropped, and being the best mounted, had come farther than anyone else—if his horse had not died he might have been riding now. The concentration of the French forces to put ten thousand men in the field had led to their evacuation of the smaller villages, so that Villena had been able to avoid capture, even though he was between the French field army and its base at Barcelona. Now that he knew what had happened there was no advantage to be gained from dwelling on Villena’s misfortunes; indeed it was better to hearten him up, as he would be more useful that way. “Defeat,” said Hornblower, “is a misfortune which every fighting man encounters sooner or later. Let us hope we shall gain our revenge for yesterday today. ” “There is more than yesterday to be revenged,” said Villena.',\n",
       " 'He put his hand in the breast of his tunic and brought out a folded wad of paper; unfolded it was a printed poster, which he handed over to Hornblower who glanced at it and took in as much of the sense as a brief perusal of the Catalan in which it was printed permitted. It began, “We, Luciano Gaetano Pino, Knight of the Legion of Honour, Knight of the Order of the Iron Crown of Lombardy, General of Division, commanding the forces of His Imperial and Royal Majesty Napoleon, Emperor of the French and King of Italy in the district of Gerona hereby decree——” There were numbered paragraphs after that, dealing with all the offences anyone could imagine against His Imperial and Royal Majesty. And each paragraph ended—Hornblower ran his eye down them—“will be shot”; “penalty of death”; “will be hanged”; “will be burned”—it was a momentary relief to discover that this last referred to villages sheltering rebels. “They have burned every village in the uplands,” said Villena.',\n",
       " '“The road from Figueras to Gerona—ten leagues long, sir—is lined with gallows, and upon every gallows is a corpse. ” “Horrible!” said Hornblower, but he did not encourage the conversation. He fancied that if any Spaniard began to talk about the woes of Spain he would never stop. “And this Pino is marching back along the coast road, you say?” “Yes. ” “Is there deep water close into the shore at any spot?” The Spaniard raised his eyebrows in protest at that question, and Hornblower realised that it was hardly fair to ask a colonel of hussars about soundings. “Are there batteries protecting the road from the sea?” he asked, instead. ” Hornblower realised that Villena was probably incapable of giving exact topographical information about anywhere, which was what he would expect of a Spanish colonel of light cavalry.',\n",
       " 'Chapter XIV HORNBLOWER HAD shaken himself free from the company of Colonel Villena, who showed, now that he had told of his defeat, a hysterical loquacity and a pathetic unwillingness to allow him out of his sight. He had established him in a chair by the taffrail out of the way, and escaped below to the security of his cabin, to pore once more over the charts. There were batteries marked there—most of them apparently dated from the time, not so long ago, when Spain had been at war with England, and they had been erected to protect coasting vessels which crept along the shore from battery to battery. In consequence they were established at points where there was not merely deep water close in, but also a bit of shelter given by projecting points of land in which the fugitives could anchor.',\n",
       " 'There had never been any thought in men’s minds then that marching columns might in the future be attacked from the sea, and exposed sections of coast—like this twenty miles between Malgret and Arens de Mar—which offered no anchorage might surely be neglected. Since Cochrane was here a year ago in the Impérieuse no British ship had been spared to harass the French in this quarter. The French since then had had too many troubles on their hands to have time to think of mere possibilities. The chances were that they had neglected to take precautions—and in any case they could not have enough heavy guns and trained gunners to guard the whole coast. The Sutherland was seeking a spot a mile and a half at least from any battery, where the water was deep enough close in for her to sweep the road with her guns. She had already hauled out of range of one battery, and that was marked on his chart and, moreover, was the only one marked along the stretch.',\n",
       " 'It was most unlikely that the French had constructed others since the chart was last brought up to date. If Pino’s column had left Malgret at dawn the Sutherland must be nearly up level with it now. Hornblower marked the spot which his instinct told him would be the most suitable, and ran up on deck to give the orders which would head the Sutherland in towards it. Villena climbed hastily out of his chair at sight of him, and clinked loudly across the deck towards him, but Hornblower contrived to ignore him politely by acting as if his whole attention was taken up by giving instructions to Bush. “I’ll have the guns loaded and run out, too, if you please, Mr. This last order, with its hint of immediate action, set the pinnacle on his curiosity. All he knew was that a Dago colonel had come on board. What they were here for, what Hornblower had in mind, he had no means of guessing.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower always kept his projected plans to himself, because then if he should fail his subordinates would not be able to guess the extent of the failure. But Bush felt sometimes that his life was being shortened by his captain’s reticence. He was pleasantly surprised this time when Hornblower condescended to make explanations, and he was never to know that Hornblower’s unusual loquaciousness was the result of a desire to be saved from having to make polite conversation with Villena. “There’s a French column expected along the road over there,” he said. “I want to see if we can get in a few shots at them. ” Now that Hornblower actually wanted to be conversational he found it impossible—for nearly three years he had checked every impulse to say an unnecessary word to his second in command; and Bush’s stolid “Aye aye sirs” were not much help. Hornblower took refuge from Villena by glueing his eye to his telescope and scanning the nearing shore with the utmost diligence.',\n",
       " 'Here there were bold grey–green hills running almost to the water’s edge, and looping along the foot of them, now ten feet up, and now a hundred feet, ran the road. As Hornblower looked at it, his glass revealed a dark tiny speck on the road far ahead. A moment later he saw a moving smudge behind, which fixed his attention by an occasional sparkle and flash from the midst of it. That was a body of horsemen; presumably the advanced guard of Pino’s army. It would not be long before the Sutherland was up opposite to them. Hornblower gauged the distance of the ship from the road. Half a mile, or a little more—easy cannon shot, though not as easy as he would like. He could edge in a good deal closer at this point, if, when he turned the ship about and followed Pino along the shore, they came as far as here. As the Sutherland proceeded to meet the advancing army, Hornblower’s brain was busy noting landmarks on the shore and the corresponding soundings opposite them.',\n",
       " 'The leading squadron of cavalry could be seen distinctly now—men riding cautiously, their sabres drawn, looking searchingly on all sides as they rode; in a war where every rock and hedge might conceal a musketeer determined on killing one enemy at least their caution was understandable. Some distance behind the leading squadron Hornblower could make out a longer column of cavalry, and beyond that again a long, long line of white dots, which puzzled him for a moment with its odd resemblance to the legs of a caterpillar all moving together. They were the white breeches of a column of infantry marching in unison; by some trick of optics their blue coats as yet showed up not at all against their grey background. He could take the Sutherland much closer in here when he wanted to. But at present it was better to stay out at half gunshot. His ship would not appear nearly as menacing to the enemy at that distance.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower’s mind was hard at work analysing the reactions of the enemy to the appearance of the Sutherland—friendly hat–waving by the cavalry of the advanced guard, now opposite him, gave him valuable additional data. Pino and his men had never yet been cannonaded from the sea, and had had no experience so far of the destructive effect of a ship’s heavy broadside against a suitable target. The graceful two–decker, with her pyramids of white sails, would be something outside their experience. Put an army in the field against them, and they could estimate its potentialities instantly, but they had never encountered ships before. His reading told him that Bonaparte’s generals tended to be careless of the lives of their men; and any steps taken to avoid the Sutherland’s fire would involve grave inconvenience—marching back to Malgret to take the inland road, or crossing the pathless hills to it direct.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower guessed that Pino, somewhere back in that long column and studying the Sutherland through his glass, would make up his mind to chance the Sutherland’s fire and would march on hoping to get through without serious loss. The cavalry at the head of the main column were opposite them. The second regiment twinkled and sparkled in the flaming sunlight like a river of fire. “Those are the cuirassiers!” said Villena, gesticulating wildly at Hornblower’s elbow. “Why do you not fire, Captain?” Hornblower realised that Villena had probably been gabbling Spanish to him for the last quarter of an hour, and he had not heard a word he had said. He was not going to waste his surprise attack on cavalry who could gallop away out of range. This opening broadside must be reserved for slow–moving infantry. Bush,” he said, forgetting all about Villena again in a flash, and to the man at the wheel, “Starboard a point. “Train the guns on the road, and only fire when I give you the signal.',\n",
       " '” A horse artillery battery had followed the cavalry—popgun six–pounders whose jolting and lurching showed well how bad was the surface of the road, one of the great highways of Spain. The men perched on the limbers waved their hands in friendly fashion to the beautiful ship close in upon them. Steady!” The ship crept on through the water; not a sound from the crew, standing tense at their guns—only the faint sweet music of the breeze in the rigging, and the lapping of the water overside. Now they were level with the infantry column, a long dense mass of blue–coated and white–breeched soldiers, stepping out manfully, a little unreal in the haze of dust. Above the blue coats could be seen the white lines of their faces—every face was turned towards the pretty white–sailed ship creeping over the blue–enamel water. It was a welcome diversion in a weary march, during a war when every day demanded its march.',\n",
       " 'Gerard was giving no orders for change of elevation at the moment—here the road ran level for half a mile, fifty feet above the sea. Before Hornblower could blow, the centre main–deck gun had exploded, and a moment later the whole broadside followed with a hideous crash. The Sutherland heeled to the recoil, and the white, bitter–tasting smoke came billowing up. The forty one balls from the Sutherland’s broadside and cannonades had swept the road from side to side. Fifty yards of the column had been cut to fragments. Whole files had been swept away; the survivors stood dazed and stupid. The gun trucks roared as the guns were run out again, and the Sutherland lurched once more at the second broadside. There was another gap in the column now, just behind the first. The whole column was standing stock still and silly to receive the third broadside; the smoke from the firing had drifted to the shore now, and was scattering over the rocks in thin wreaths.',\n",
       " 'In the deepening water Hornblower could close nearer in. The next section of the column, seeing the terrible ship moving down upon them implacably, about to blast them into death, was seized with panic and bolted wildly down the road. “Starboard a point!” Farther down the road the column had not fled. Those who stood firm and those who ran jammed the road with a struggling mass of men, and the Sutherland under the orders of her captain closed in upon them pitilessly, like a machine, steadied again, brought her guns to bear upon the crowd, and then swept the road clear with her tempest of grapeshot as though with a broom. ” Villena was snapping his fingers and dancing about the deck like a clown, dolman flying, plume nodding, spurs jangling. But Hornblower’s eye had caught sight of the little point jutting out from the shore close ahead, and its hint of jagged rock at its foot.',\n",
       " 'His mind was working at a feverish pace—there was water enough here, but that point indicated a reef—a ridge of harder rock which had not been ground away like the rest of the shore, and remained as a trap below the surface on which the Sutherland might run without warning between two casts of the lead. The Sutherland came up to the wind, and stood out from the shore. Looking aft, they could see the stretch of road which she had swept with her fire. One or two men stood among the wreck; a few were bending over the wounded, but most of the survivors were on the hillside above the road, scattered on the steep slopes, their white breeches silhouetted against the grey background. Beyond the little point there would be deep water close in again, as there had been on the other side of it. At the sight of the Sutherland heading for them the infantry on the road scattered wildly up the hillside, but the battery of artillery beyond had no such means of escape open to it.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower saw drivers and gunners sitting helplessly for an instant; then he saw the officer in command, his plume tossing, gallop along the line, calling the men to action with urgent gesticulations. The drivers wheeled their horses in the road, swinging their guns across it, the gunners leaping down from the limbers, unhooking the gun trails, and bending over their guns as they worked frantically to bring them into action. Could a battery of nine–pounder field pieces effect anything against the Sutherland’s broadside? “Reserve your fire for the battery, Mr. One gun went off prematurely—Hornblower was glad to see Gerard noting the fact so as to punish the gun’s crew later—and then the whole broadside was delivered with a crash, at the moment when the Italian artillerymen were still at work with their rammers loading their guns.',\n",
       " 'The rush of smoke obscured the view from the quarterdeck; it did not clear until already one or two well–served guns were rumbling up into firing position again. By that time the wind had rolled it away in a solid bank, and they could see the hard–hit battery. One gun had had a wheel smashed, and was leaning drunkenly over to one side; another, apparently hit full on the muzzle, had been flung back from its carriage and was pointing up to the sky. There were dead men lying round the guns, and the living were standing dazed by the torrent of shot which had delayed them. The mounted officer had just flung himself from his saddle and let his horse go free while he ran to the nearest gun. Hornblower could see him calling the men about him, determined on firing one shot at least in defiance of the thundering tormentor. “Give ’em another, men!” shouted Gerard, and the Sutherland heeled once more to the broadside.',\n",
       " 'By the time the smoke cleared away the Sutherland had passed on, leaving the battery behind. Hornblower could see it wrecked and ruined, another of its guns dismounted, and not a man visible on his feet near the guns. Now the Sutherland was opposite more infantry—the second division of the column, presumably—which shredded away in panic up the hillside section by section as the Sutherland neared them. He knew that it was as damaging to an army to be scattered and broken up like this as for it to be decimated by fire; he would as soon not kill the poor devils, except that his own men would be more delighted at casualties among the enemy than at a mere demoralisation whose importance they could not appreciate. There was a group of horsemen on the hillside above the road. Through his telescope he could see that they were all splendidly mounted, and dressed in a variety of uniforms flashing with gold and diversified with plumes.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower guessed them to be the staff of the army; they would serve well as a target in the absence of larger bodies of formed troops. His two midshipmen–messengers went running below to point out the new target to the officers on the lower gun deck; Gerard himself bent over the nearest gun and squinted along it, while the gun captains set the tangent sights in accordance with the orders he bellowed through his speaking trumpet. Gerard stood aside and jerked the lanyard, and the whole broadside followed the shot he fired. Men and horses went down together; there was hardly a rider left in his saddle. So universal was the destruction that Hornblower guessed that close under the surface soil must be rock, flying chips of which had scattered like grapeshot. He wondered if Pino were among those hit, and found himself to his surprise hoping that Pino had had both legs shot off.',\n",
       " 'He told himself that until that morning he had not even heard Pino’s name, and he felt a momentary scorn for himself, for feeling a blind animosity towards a man merely because he was his opponent. Some officer a little farther down the road had kept his men together, drawn up stubbornly in a mass along the road, refusing to allow them to scatter. It was small advantage that his stern discipline brought his men. Hornblower brought his ship steadily round until the guns bore, and then tore the steady regiment to fragments with a fresh broadside. As the smoke eddied round him a sharp rap on the rail at his side made him look down. There was a musket ball stuck there—someone had fired at long range, two hundred yards or more, and succeeded in hitting the ship. The ball must have been nearly spent when it arrived, for it was embedded to half its depth and had retained its shape.',\n",
       " 'It was just too hot to touch; he picked it out with his handkerchief over his fingers, and juggled with it idly, as he had done, he told himself, with hot chestnuts when he was a boy. The clearing smoke revealed the new destruction he had wrought, the slaughtered files and heaped–up dead; he fancied that he could even hear the screaming of the wounded. He was glad that the troops were scattering up the hillside and presenting no target, for he was sick of slaughter although Bush was still blaspheming with excitement and Villena still capering at his side. Surely he must reach the rear of the column soon—from advanced guard to rearguard the army could not occupy more than eight or nine miles of road. As the thought came into his head he saw the road here was full of stationary waggons—the baggage train of the army.',\n",
       " 'Those squat vehicles with four horses apiece must be ammunition caissons; beyond was a string of country carts, each with its half dozen patient oxen, dun–coloured, with sheepskins hanging over their foreheads. Filling the rest of the road beside the carts were pack mules, hundreds of them, looking grotesquely malformed with their ungainly burdens on their backs. There was no sign of a human being—the drivers were mere dots climbing the hillside, having abandoned their charges. The Account of the Present War in the Peninsula which Hornblower had so attentively studied had laid great stress on the difficulties of transport in Spain. A mule or horse was as valuable —several times as valuable, for that matter—as any soldier. ” A little wail went up from the men at the guns who heard the words. It was just like those sentimental fools to cheer when they killed men and yet to object to killing animals. Half of them would deliberately miss if they had the chance.',\n",
       " 'The patient brutes would stand to be shot at, unlike their masters, and the gun layers would have no opportunity to waste ammunition. As the Sutherland drifted slowly along the shore her guns spoke out one by one, each one in turn hurling a hatful of grape, at extreme grapeshot range, onto the road. Hornblower watched horses and mules go down, kicking and plunging. One or two of the pack mules, maddened with fear, managed to leap the bank out of the road and scramble up the hill, scattering their burdens as they did so. Six oxen attached to a cart all went down together, dead simultaneously. Held together by their yokes they stayed, two by two, on their knees and bellies, their heads stretched forward, as if in prayer. The main deck murmured again in pity as the men saw the result of the good shot. “Silence there!” roared Gerard, who could guess at the importance of the work in hand.',\n",
       " 'Bush plucked at his captain’s sleeve, daring greatly in thus breaking in on his preoccupation with a suggestion. If I took a boat’s crew ashore I could burn all those waggons, destroy everything there. It was like Bush not to see the objections to such a plan. The enemy might fly before guns to which they had no chance of replying, but if a landing party were put within their reach they would fall upon it fiercely enough—more fiercely than ever as a result of their recent losses. It was one thing to land a small party to attack fifty artillerymen in a battery taken completely by surprise, but it was quite another to land in the face of a disciplined army ten thousand strong. The words with which Hornblower tried to soften his refusal were blown into inaudibility by the explosion of the quarterdeck cannonade beside them, and when Hornblower again opened his mouth to speak there was a fresh distraction on the shore to interrupt him.',\n",
       " 'Someone was standing up in the next cart destined to receive fire, waving a white handkerchief frantically. Hornblower looked through his glass; the man appeared to be an officer of some sort, in his blue uniform with red epaulettes. But if he were trying to surrender he must know that his surrender could not be accepted in that it could not be put into effect. He stooped down in the cart and rose again still waving his handkerchief and supporting someone who had been lying at his feet. Hornblower could see that the man hung limp in his arms; there was a white bandage round his head and another round his arm, and Hornblower suddenly realised that these carts were the ambulance vehicles of the army, full of the sick and of the wounded from yesterday’s skirmish. The officer with the handkerchief must be a surgeon. “Cease fire!” bellowed Hornblower, shrilling on his whistle.',\n",
       " 'He was too late to prevent the next shot being fired, but luckily it was badly sighted and merely raised a cloud of dust from the cliff face below the road. It was illogical to spare draught animals which might be invaluable to the French for fear of hitting wounded men who might recover and again be active enemies, but it was the convention of war, deriving its absurdity from war itself. Beyond the waggon train was the rearguard, but that was scattered over the hillside sparsely enough not to be worth powder and shot. It was time to go back and harass the main body once more. ” It was not so easy on a course diametrically opposite to the previous one. The wind had been on the Sutherland’s quarter before; now it was on her bow and she could only keep parallel to the shore by lying as close–hauled as she would sail.',\n",
       " 'To make any offing at all when they reached the little capes which ran out from the shore the ship would have to go about, and the leeway she made might drift her into danger unless the situation were carefully watched. But the utmost must be done to harass the Italians and to demonstrate to them that they could never use the coast road again; Bush was delighted—as Hornblower could see from the fierce light in his eyes—that his captain was going to stick to his task and not sail tamely off after defiling once along the column, and the men at the starboard–side guns rubbed their hands with pleasure at the prospect of action as they bent over the weapons that had stood unused so far. It took time for the Sutherland to go about and work into position again for her guns to command the road; Hornblower was pleased to see the regiments which had reformed break up again as their tormentor neared them and take to the hillside once more.',\n",
       " 'But close–hauled the Sutherland could hardly make three knots past the land, allowing for the vagaries of the coast line and the wind; troops stepping out as hard as they could go along the road could keep their distance from her if necessary, and perhaps the Italian officers might realise this soon enough. Gerard!” he called, and Gerard came running to his beckoning, standing with face uplifted to hear his orders from the quarterdeck. “You may fire single shots at any group large enough to be worth it. ” There was a body of a hundred men or so massed on the hillside opposite them now. Gerard himself laid the gun and estimated the range, squatting on his heels to look along the dispart sights with the gun at full elevation. The ball struck the rock in front of them and ricochetted into the group; Hornblower saw a sudden swirl in the crowd, which scattered abruptly leaving two or three white–breeched figures stretched on the ground behind it.',\n",
       " 'Marsh the gunner had been hurriedly sent for by Gerard to take part in this accurate shooting; the gun he was training killed more men in another group, over which flashed something on a pole which Hornblower, straining his eye through his telescope, decided must be one of the imperial eagles which Bonaparte’s bulletins so often mentioned and at which British cartoonists so often jeered. Shot after shot crashed out from the Sutherland’s starboard battery as she made her slow way along the coast. Sometimes the crew cheered when some of the scrambling midgets on the hillside were knocked over; sometimes the shot was received in chill silence when no effect could be noted.',\n",
       " 'It was a valuable demonstration to the gunners on the importance of being able to lay their guns truly, to estimate range and deflection, even though it was traditional in a ship of the line that all the gunners had to do was to serve their guns as fast as possible with no necessity for taking aim with their ship laid close alongside the enemy. Now that the ear was not deafened by the thunder of a full broadside, it could detect after each shot the flattened echo thrown back by the hills, returning from the land with its quality oddly altered in the heated air. For it was frightfully hot; Hornblower, watching the men drinking eagerly at the scuttle butt as their petty officers released them in turns for the purpose, wondered if those poor devils scrambling over the rocky hillsides in the glaring sun were suffering from thirst.',\n",
       " 'He had no inclination to drink himself—he was too preoccupied listening to the chant of the men at the lead, with watching the effect of the firing and with seeing that the Sutherland was running into no danger. Whoever was in command of the shattered field–artillery battery farther along the road was a man who knew his duty. Midshipman Savage in the foretop attracted Hornblower’s attention to it with a hail. The three serviceable guns had been slewed round to point diagonally across the road straight at the ship, and they fired the moment Hornblower trained his glass on them. Wirra–wirra–wirra; one of the balls passed high over Hornblower’s head, and a hole appeared in the Sutherland’s main topsail. At the same time a crash forward told where another shot had struck home. It would be ten minutes before the Sutherland’s broadside could bear on the battery.',\n",
       " '” As part of the programme for training his men into fighting machines it would be invaluable to give them firing practice while actually under fire from the enemy—no one knew better than Hornblower the difference between being fired at and not being fired at. He found himself in the act of thinking that one or two unimportant casualties might be worth receiving in these circumstances as part of the crew’s necessary experience, and then he drew back in horror from the thought that he was casually condemning some of his own men to mutilation or death—and he might himself be one of those casualties. It was intolerably easy to separate mentally the academic theories of war from the human side of it, even when one was engaged in it oneself.',\n",
       " 'To his men down below the little uniformed figures scrambling over the hillside were not human beings suffering agonies from heat and thirst and fatigue; and the still figures which littered the road here were not disembowelled corpses, lately fathers or lovers. They might as well be tin soldiers for all his men thought about them. It was mad that at that moment, irrelevantly in the heat, and the din of firing, he should start thinking about Lady Barbara and her pendant of sapphires, and Maria, who must now be growing ungainly with her child within her. He shook himself free from such thoughts—while they had filled his mind the battery had fired another salvo whose effect he actually had not noticed. The bow chasers were banging away at the battery; their fire might unsteady the men at the field guns.',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile the broadside guns were finding few targets offered them, for the Italian division opposite them had scattered widely all over the hillside in groups of no more than half a dozen at the most—some of them were right up on the skyline. Their officers would have a difficult time reassembling them, and any who wished to desert —the Account of the Present War in the Peninsula had laid stress on the tendency of the Italians to desert—would have ample opportunity today. A crash and a cry below told that a shot from the battery had caused one at least of the casualties Hornblower had been thinking about—from the highpitched scream of agony it must have been one of the ship’s boys who had been hit; he set his lips firm as he measured the distance the ship still had to sail before bringing her broadside to bear. He would have to receive two more salvos; it was the tiniest bit difficult to wait for them.',\n",
       " 'Here came one—it passed close overhead with a sound like an infinity of bees on an urgent mission; apparently the gunners had made inadequate allowance for the rapidly decreasing range. The main topgallant backstay parted with a crack, and a gesture from Bush sent a party to splice it. The Sutherland would have to swing out now in readiness to weather the point and reef ahead. Be ready to open fire on the battery when the guns bear. Hooker was forward in charge of the headsail sheets. The Sutherland came beautifully up into the wind as her helm was put down, and Hornblower watched the field guns, now less than a quarter of a mile away, through his glass. The gunners saw the Sutherland swinging round—they had seen that before, and knew the tempest of shot that would follow. Hornblower saw one man run from the guns, and saw others follow him, clawing their way desperately up the bank onto the hillside.',\n",
       " 'Others flung themselves flat on their faces—only one man was left standing, raving and gesticulating beside the guns. Then the Sutherland heaved to the recoil of her guns once more, the acrid smoke came billowing up, and the battery was blotted out of sight. Even when the smoke cleared the battery could not be seen. There were only fragments—shattered wheels, an axle tree pointing upwards, the guns themselves lying tumbled on the ground. That had been a well–aimed broadside; the men must have behaved as steadily as veterans. Hornblower took his ship out round the reef and stood in again for the shore. On the road just ahead was the rear of an infantry column; the leading division must have been formed up again on the road while the Sutherland was dealing with the second one. Now it was marching off down the road at a great pace, embanked in a low, heavy cloud of dust.',\n",
       " '” But the Sutherland was a poor sailor close–hauled, and time and again when she was on the point of overtaking the rear of the column she had to go about and head out from the shore in order to weather a projecting point of land. Sometimes she was so close to the hurrying infantry that Hornblower could see through his glass the white faces above the blue tunics of the men looking back over their shoulders. And here and there along the road in the track of the division he saw men who had fallen out—men sitting by the roadside with their heads in their hands, men leaning exhausted on their muskets staring at the ship gliding by, sometimes men lying motionless and unconscious on their faces where they had fallen, overwhelmed by fatigue and heat.',\n",
       " 'Bush was fretting and fuming as he hastened about the ship trying to coax a little more speed out of her, setting every spare man to work carrying hammocks laden with shot from the lee side to the weather side, trimming the sails to the nicest possible degree of accuracy, blaspheming wildly whenever the gap between ship and men showed signs of lengthening. An infantry division which had been knocked about as badly as this one, and then sent flying helter–skelter in panic for miles, dropping stragglers by the score, and pursued by a relentless enemy, would have such a blow to its self–respect as to be vastly weakened as a fighting force for weeks.',\n",
       " 'Before he came into range of the big coastal battery on the farther side of Arens de Mar he gave over the pursuit—he did not want the flying enemy to recover any of its lost spirit by seeing the Sutherland driven off by the fire of the heavy guns there, and to circle round out of range would consume so much time that night would be upon them before they could be back on the coast again. You can put the ship on the starboard tack and secure the guns. ” The Sutherland steadied to an even keel, and then heeled over again as she paid off on the other tack. “Three cheers for the cap’n,” yelled someone on the main deck—Hornblower could not be sure who it was, or he would have punished him. The storm of cheering that instantly followed drowned his voice and prevented him from checking the men, who shouted until they were tired, all grinning with enthusiasm for the captain who had led them to victory five times in three days. Bush was grinning too, and Gerard, beside him on the quarterdeck.',\n",
       " 'Little Longley was dancing and yelling with an utter disregard for an officer’s dignity, while Hornblower stood sullenly glowering down at the men below. Later he might be delighted at the recollection of this spontaneous proof of the men’s affection and devotion, but at present it merely irritated and embarrassed him. As the cheering died away the voice of the leadsman made itself heard again. “No bottom! No bottom with this line!” He was still doing the duty to which he had been assigned, and would continue to do it until he received orders to rest—a most vivid example of the discipline of the Navy. Bush!” snapped Hornblower, annoyed at the omission to relieve the man. “Aye aye, sir,” said Bush, chagrined at having been for once remiss in his work. The sun was dipping in purple and red into the mountains of Spain, in a wild debauch of colour that made Hornblower catch his breath as he looked at the extravagant beauty of it.',\n",
       " 'He was mazed and stupid now, in reaction from his exalted quickness of thought of the preceding hours; too stupid as yet even to be conscious of any fatigue. Yet he must still wait to receive the surgeon’s report. Someone had been killed or wounded today—he remembered vividly the crash and the cry when the shot from the field guns hit the ship. The gunroom steward had come up on the quarterdeck and touched his forehead to Gerard. He could remember no man on board of the name of Tom Cribb—which was the name of the heavyweight champion of England—nor any reason why the gunroom steward should report a casualty to a lieutenant. “Tom Cribb’s been killed, sir,” explained the steward. Siddons, she’s got a splinter in ’er—in ’er backside, begging your pardon, sir. Siddons must be a pig and a sow belonging to the gunroom mess. ” Here came Walsh the surgeon with his report that there had been no casualties in the action.',\n",
       " '“Excepting among the pigs in the manger, sir,” added Walsh, with a deprecating deference of one who proffers a joke to his superior officer. If it’s leathery like the last time we killed a pig, I’ll have your grog stopped. There’s onions and there’s sage—yes, and there’s a few apples left. Sage and onions and apple sauce—and mark you this, Loughton, don’t put any cloves in that sauce. No matter what the other officers say, I won’t have ’em. You can take a leg to the bos’n’s mess with my compliments, and roast the other one—it’ll serve cold for breakfast. ” Gerard was striking the fingers of one hand into the palm of the other to accentuate his points; the light of appetite was in his face—Hornblower fancied that when there were no women available Gerard gave all the thought he could spare from his guns to his belly.',\n",
       " 'A man whose eyes could go moist with appetite at the thought of fried chitterlings and roast pork for dinner on a scorching July afternoon in the Mediterranean, and who could look forward with pleasure to cold leg of pork for breakfast next day should by rights have been fat like a pig himself, but Gerard was lean and handsome and elegant. Hornblower thought of the developing paunch within his own waistband with momentary jealousy. But Colonel Villena was wandering about the quarterdeck like a lost soul. Clearly he was simply living for the moment when he would be able to start talking again—and Hornblower was the only soul on board with enough Spanish to maintain a conversation. Moreover, as a colonel he ranked with a post captain, and could expect to share the hospitality of the captain’s cabin. Hornblower decided that he would rather be overfed with hot roast pork than have to endure Villena’s conversation. ” “Would my presence be unwelcome in the gunroom to share it?” “Oh no, sir.',\n",
       " '” Gerard’s face lit with genuine pleasure at the prospect of acting as host to his captain. It was such a sincere tribute that Hornblower’s heart was warmed, even while his conscience pricked him at the memory of why he had invited himself. Then Colonel Villena and myself will be guests of the gunroom tonight. ” With any luck, Villena would be seated far enough from him to save him from the necessity for Spanish conversation. The marine sergeant drummer had brought out all that the ship could boast of a band—the four marine fifers and the four drummers. They were marching up and down the gangway to the thunder and the rumble of the drums while the fifes squealed away bravely at the illimitable horizon. “Hearts of oak are our ships Jolly tars are our men——” The bald words and the trite sentiments seemed to please the crew, although every man jack of it would have been infuriated if he had been called a “jolly tar.',\n",
       " '” Up and down went the smart red coats, and the jaunty beat of the drums thrilled so that the crushing heat was forgotten. In the west the marvellous sky still flamed in glory, even while in the east the night was creeping up over the purple sea.',\n",
       " 'It seemed to him as if he could not have been asleep more than five minutes, while actually it had been well over an hour. He lay on his cot in his nightshirt, for he had thrown off his coverings during the sweltering heat of the night; his head ached and his mouth had a foul taste. He had retired to bed at midnight, but—thanks to roast pork for supper—he had tossed and turned in the frightful heat for two or three hours before going to sleep, and now here he was awakened at four o’clock in the morning, simply because he had to prepare his report to Captain Bolton or to the admiral (if the latter had arrived) for delivery that morning at the rendezvous. He groaned miserably with fatigue, and his joints ached as he put his feet to the deck and sat up. His eyes were gummy and hard to open, and they felt sore when he rubbed them.',\n",
       " 'He would have groaned again except for the need to appear in Polwheal’s eyes superior to human weaknesses—at the thought of that he stood up abruptly and posed as somebody feeling perfectly wide awake. A bath under the wash–deck pump, and a shave made the pose almost a reality, and then, with dawn creeping up over the misty horizon, he sat down at his desk and cut himself a new pen, licked its point meditatively before dipping it into the ink, and began to write. “I have the honour to report that in accordance with the orders of Captain Bolton, on the 20th inst. , I proceeded——” Polwheal came in with his breakfast, and Hornblower turned to the steaming hot coffee for a spur to his already flagging energies. He flipped the pages of the ship’s log to refresh his memory—so much had happened lately that he was actually vague already about the details of the capture of the Amelie.',\n",
       " 'The report had to be written badly, avoiding Gibbonesque antitheses or high–flying sentiment, yet at the same time Hornblower disliked the use of the kind of phrasing which was customary in captain’s reports. When listing the prizes taken from beside the battery at Llanza he was careful to write “as named in the margin” instead of the irritating phrase “as per margin” which had become stereotyped in the Navy since its classic use by an unlettered captain nearly a hundred years before the War of Jenkins’ Ear. He was compelled to use the word “proceed” even though he hated it—in official reports the Navy never set sail, nor went, nor put to sea, nor journeyed, but always proceeded, just as in the same way captains never suggested or advised or recommended, but always respectfully submitted. Hornblower had respectfully to submit that until the French battery was reestablished at Llanza the coastal route from France to Spain was now most vulnerable between Port Vendres and Rosas Bay.',\n",
       " 'While he struggled with the wording of his description of the raid on the Etang de Thau near Cette he was interrupted by a knock on his door. Gerard, and will he please alter course to close her. ” His report would have to be addressed to the admiral, then, and not to Captain Bolton, and it would have to be finished within the next half hour. He dashed his pen into the ink and began to scribble feverishly, describing the harassing of the divisions of Pino and Lecchi on the coast road between Malgret and Arens de Mar. It came as a shock to him when he computed the casualties inflicted on the Italians—they must have numbered five or six hundred, exclusive of stragglers. He had to word that carefully, otherwise he would probably be suspected of gross exaggeration, a serious crime in the eyes of authority. Yesterday five or six hundred men were killed or mutilated who today would have been alive and well if he had not been an active and enterprising officer.',\n",
       " 'The mental eyes with which Hornblower viewed his exploit saw a double image—on the one hand he saw corpses, widows and orphans, misery and pain, while on the other he saw white–breeched figurines motionless on a hillside, tin soldiers knocked over, arithmetical digits recorded on paper. He cursed his analytical mind at the same time as he cursed the heat and the need for writing the report. He was even vaguely conscious of his own cross–grainedness, which always plunged him into depression after a success. He dashed off his signature to the document, and shouted for Polwheal to bring a candle to melt the sealing wax while he peppered sand over the wet ink. Thanks to the heat his hands stuck clammily to the limp paper. When he came to address the report—“Rear Admiral Sir P. ”—the ink spread and ran on the smeared surface as though on blotting paper. But at any rate the thing was done; he went on deck, where already the sunshine was oppressive.',\n",
       " 'The brassiness of the sky, noticeable yesterday, was far more marked today, and Hornblower had noticed that the barometer in his cabin indicated a steady fall which had begun three days ago. There was a storm coming, without a doubt, and moreover a storm which had so long been foretold would be all the more violent when it did come. He turned to Gerard with orders to keep a sharp eye on the weather and to be ready to shorten sail at the first hint of trouble. Over there rolled the two other ships of the squadron, the Pluto with her three tiers of ports, and the red ensign at the mizzen masthead indicating the presence on board of a rear admiral of the Red, and the Caligula astern of her. Marsh to salute the admiral’s flag,” said Hornblower. While the salute was being returned a hoist of flags ran up the Pluto’s rigging. Where’s Colonel Villena?” “Not seen him yet this morning, sir. I want him ready as soon as my barge is cleared away.',\n",
       " '” It took two and a half minutes before the captain’s barge was in the water with Hornblower seated in the stern, and at the very last second Villena made his appearance at the ship’s side. He looked as disagreeable as might be expected, at having been routed out of bed by two brusque midshipmen who could speak no word of his language and dressed with their clumsy and hurried aid. His busby was awry and his coat incorrectly hooked, and his sabre and pelisse still hung over his arm. He was hauled down into the boat by the impatient boat’s crew, who did not want to imperil their ship’s reputation for smartness by waiting for him after the admiral had signalled for them. Villena lurched miserably to his thwart beside Hornblower. He was unshaven and bedraggled, and his eyes were as gummy as Hornblower’s had been on his awakening.',\n",
       " 'He sat down muttering and grumbling, still half asleep, trying in dazed fashion to complete his dressing, while the men bent to their oars and sent the barge skimming over the water. It was only as they neared the flagship that Villena was able to open his eyes fully and begin to talk, and for the short remaining period Hornblower felt no need for elaborate politeness. He was full of hope that the admiral would invite Villena to be his guest for the sake of any information he could give regarding conditions ashore. Captain Elliott was at the ship’s side to greet him as they came on board. “Glad to see you, Hornblower,” he said, and then in response to Hornblower’s introduction he mumbled incoherently to Villena, eyeing the latter’s gaudy uniform and unshaven chin in blank astonishment. He was obviously relieved when the formality was over and he could address himself to Hornblower again.',\n",
       " '” The flag lieutenant in the admiral’s cabin along with the admiral was young Sylvester, whom Hornblower had heard of as a capable young officer even though he was—as might have been expected—a sprig of the nobility. Leighton himself was ponderous and slow of speech this morning; in the stifling heat the sweat was visible in little rivers running down the sides of his heavy chin. He and Sylvester made a brave attempt to welcome Villena. They both of them spoke French fairly well and Italian badly, and by amalgamating what they knew of those two languages with what remained of their schoolboy Latin they were able to make themselves understood, but it was heavy going. Obviously with relief Leighton turned to Hornblower. But let us hear a little about your doings verbally. Captain Bolton tells me he spoke a prize you had taken.',\n",
       " 'Where did you go?” Hornblower began his account—he was glad that events had moved so fast that he was able to omit all reference to the circumstances in which he had parted company from the East India convoy. He told of his capture of the Amelie and of the little fleet of small vessels at Llanza. The admiral’s heavy face showed a gleam of extra animation when he heard that he was a thousand pounds the richer as a result of Hornblower’s activity, and he nodded sympathetically when Hornblower explained the necessity of burning the last prize he had taken—the coaster near Cette. Cautiously Hornblower put forward the suggestion that the squadron might be most profitably employed in watching between Port Vendres and Rosas, on which stretch, thanks to the destruction of the battery at Llanza, there was now no refuge for French shipping. A hint of a groove appeared between the admiral’s eyebrows at that, and Hornblower swerved away from the subject.',\n",
       " 'Clearly Leighton was not the sort of admiral to welcome suggestions from his inferiors. Hornblower hurriedly began to deal with the next day’s action to the southwestward. “You mean you went southward the night before last?” “Yes, sir. ” “You must have passed close to this rendezvous during the darkness?” “Yes, sir. ” “You made no attempt to ascertain whether the flagship had arrived?” “I gave orders for a specially good lookout to be kept, sir. ” The groove between Leighton’s eyebrows was very noticeable now. Admirals were always plagued by the tendency of their captains, when on blockade service, to make excuses to get away and act independently—if only because it increased their share of prize money—and obviously Leighton was not merely determined to deal drastically with any such tendency but also he guessed that Hornblower had been careful to arrange his cruise so as to pass the rendezvous at night.',\n",
       " '“I am extremely annoyed, Captain Hornblower, that you should have acted in such a fashion. I have already admonished Captain Bolton for allowing you to go, and now that I find you were within ten miles of here two nights ago I find it difficult to express my displeasure. I reached the rendezvous that very evening, as it happened, and as a result of your behaviour two of His Majesty’s ships of the line have been kept idle here for nearly forty eight hours until you should see fit to rejoin. Please understand, Captain Hornblower, that I am very annoyed indeed, and I shall have to report my annoyance to the admiral commanding in the Mediterranean, for him to take any action he thinks necessary. He tried to look as contrite as he could, but his judgment told him that it was not a courtmartial matter—he was covered by Bolton’s orders—and it was doubtful if Leighton would really carry out his threat of reporting to higher authority.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower began to describe the action against the Italian divisions. He could see by Leighton’s expression that he attached little importance to the moral effect achieved, and that his imagination was not powerful enough to allow him to gauge the effect on the Italians of an ignominious retreat before an invulnerable enemy. At Hornblower’s suggestion that they had lost five hundred men at least Leighton moved restlessly and exchanged glances with Sylvester—he clearly did not believe him. Hornblower decided discreetly not to put forward his estimate that the Italians had lost at least another five hundred men through straggling and desertion. “Very interesting,” said Leighton, a trifle insincerely. A knock at the cabin door and the entrance of Elliott eased the situation. “I was thinking that if Captain Hornblower wishes to rejoin his ship——” “Yes, of course,” said Leighton, rising. From the deck they could see black clouds to leeward, rising rapidly against the wind.',\n",
       " '“You’ll only just have time,” said Elliott, looking at the sky as Hornblower prepared to go down into his barge. His main anxiety was to get away from the Pluto before anyone noticed that he was leaving Villena behind—the latter, with no understanding of the English conversation, was hanging back on the quarterdeck, and Hornblower was able to scramble down into the boat without anyone thinking of him. “Give way,” said Hornblower, before he was fairly seated, and the barge shot away from the Pluto’s side. With an admiral and his staff on board, the accommodation, three–decker though she was, must already be strained. The presence of a Spanish colonel would mean that some unfortunate lieutenant would be rendered extremely uncomfortable. But Hornblower could harden his heart to the troubles of the unknown lieutenant.',\n",
       " 'Chapter XVI THE THUNDER was already rolling on the horizon when Hornblower set foot on the Sutherland’s deck again, although the heat showed no signs of diminishing at present and the wind had dropped away almost to nothing. The black clouds had stretched over the sky nearly overhead, and what blue was left was of a hard metallic tint. He looked complacently upwards; the Sutherland’s sail had already been reduced by his orders to topsails only, and now the crew were busy taking a reef in them. ” He mopped his sweating forehead; the heat was frightful, and the ship, with no wind to steady her, was heaving painfully on the uneasy sea. A breath of air, hot as though from a brick kiln, stole upon them, and the Sutherland steadied for a moment. The black sky was suddenly split by dazzling lightning, followed almost instantaneously by a tremendous crash of thunder, and the squall came racing down upon them; they could see its hard, metallic line on the surface of the grey sea.',\n",
       " 'Almost taken aback, the Sutherland shuddered and plunged. Hornblower bellowed orders to the helmsman, and she paid off before it, steadying again. The shrieking wind brought hail with it—hailstones as big as cherries, which bit and blinded and stung, rattling with an infernal din on the decks, and whipping the sea into a yeasty foam whose hiss was audible even through the other noises. Bush held the big collar of his tarpaulin coat up round his face, and tried to shield his eyes with the brim of his sou’wester, but Hornblower found the keen wind so delicious that he was unconscious of the pain the hailstones caused him. Polwheal, who came running up on deck with his tarpaulin and sou’wester, had positively to jog his elbow to attract his attention and get him to put them on. The Pluto, hove to, came drifting down two cables’ lengths clear of the Sutherland’s starboard bow; the big three–decker was even more unhandy and made more leeway than the Sutherland herself.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower watched her and wondered how Villena was feeling now, battened down below with the timbers groaning round him. He was commending himself to the saints, presumably. The Caligula was still up to windward under reefed topsails, her man–o’–war pendant blown out stiff and straight as a pole. She was the most weatherly of the three ships, for her British designers had had in mind as principal object the building of a ship to contend with storms—not, as in the case of the Pluto, of cramming the utmost artillery into a given length and beam, nor, as the Dutch designers had been compelled to do in the case of the Sutherland, to give the minimum of draught compatible with a maximum of seaworthiness. Almost without warning the wind whipped round four whole points, and the Sutherland lurched and plunged, her storm canvas slatting like a discharge of guns, before she paid off again.',\n",
       " 'The hail had given place to torrential rain now, driven along almost horizontally by the howling wind, and the sudden change in the wind called up a short, lumpy sea over which the Sutherland bucked and plunged in ungainly fashion. He looked over to the Pluto—she had been caught nearly aback, but Elliott was handling her well and she had paid off in time. Hornblower felt that he would rather command the flat–bottomed old Sutherland than a clumsy three–decker, ninety eight guns and thirty–two–pounders and first–rate’s pay notwithstanding. The wind shrieked at him again, nearly tearing his tarpaulin from his back. The Sutherland trying to lie over on her side in a gale like this was like a cow trying to waltz. Hornblower caught the words “relieving tackles” and nodded, and Bush vanished below.',\n",
       " 'Four men at the wheel, aided by the powerful leverage of the barrel of the wheel, might possibly manage to control it despite the Sutherland’s frantic behaviour, but the strain thrown on the tiller ropes would be enormous, and as precautionary measure it would be better to place six or eight men at relieving tackles in the gunroom, to share the strain both on the men at the wheel and on the tiller ropes. A petty officer would have to be posted at the grating nearest the wheel to shout down instructions to the men at the relieving tackles—all highly skilled work, the thought of which made Hornblower bless his own resolution in stripping the East India convoy of seamen. To windward the horizon was concealed in a pearly mistiness of rare beauty, but to leeward it was clearer, and reaching up to the sky in that direction there was a bar of blue—the mountains of Spain.',\n",
       " 'In that direction there was Rosas Bay, poor shelter with the present southeasterly gale blowing, and closed to British ships in any case because of the French guns mounted there; Rosas was a fortress whose siege and capture by the French had provided Cochrane with opportunities for distinguishing himself a year ago. The northern extremity of Rosas Bay was Cape Creus—the Sutherland had captured the Amelie while the latter was endeavouring to weather this point. Beyond Cape Creus the coast trended away again northwesterly, giving them ample sea room in which to ride out the gale, for these summer storms in the Mediterranean never lasted long, violent though they were. “Flagship’s signalling, sir,” yelled the midshipman of the watch. ” The Pluto was showing storm staysails as well as her close–reefed topsails; apparently the admiral had decided that Cape Creus was dangerously near, and wished to claw out a little farther to windward in case of emergencies.',\n",
       " 'It was a sensible precaution; Hornblower gave the necessary orders to set the Sutherland on the same course, although it was all that the men at the wheel and relieving tackles could do to keep her from coming up into the wind. The guns’ crews were busy double–breeching the guns lest the heavings of the ship should cause any to break loose, and there was already a party of men at work on the two chain pumps. The working of the ship was not causing her to take in much water as yet, but Hornblower believed in keeping the well as clear as possible in case the time should come when pumping would be urgently necessary. The Caligula was far to windward already—Bolton was making the fullest use of the weatherly qualities of his ship and was keeping, very properly, as far as possible out of harm’s way. But the Sutherland and the Pluto were safe enough, always excepting accidents.',\n",
       " 'The loss of a spar, a gun breaking loose, a sudden leak developing, and the situation might be dramatically changed, but at present they were safe enough. Overhead the thunder was rolling so unceasingly that Hornblower noticed it no longer. The play of the lightning among the black clouds was dazzling and beautiful. At this rate the storm could not last much longer; equilibrium was restoring itself fast. But there would be some flurries yet, and the wind had already kicked up a heavy sea, here in this shallow corner of the Mediterranean; there was plenty of water washing over the main deck as the Sutherland rolled. The air, even the deluges of rain and spray, were exhilarating after the stifling heat of the past few days, and the wind screaming in the rigging made a music which even Hornblower’s tone–deaf ear could appreciate. He was surprised that so much time had passed when Polwheal came to tell him his dinner was ready—what dinner there was, with the galley fire extinguished.',\n",
       " 'When he came on deck again the wind had sensibly diminished, and over to windward there were patches of clear sky to be seen, of a steely green–blue, and the rain had ceased, although the sea was wilder than ever. “It’s blown itself out quick enough, sir,” said Bush. “Yes,” answered Hornblower, but with mental reservation. That steely sky was not the blue of returning calm, and he never yet had known one of these Mediterranean storms die away without at least one expiring effort. And he was still very conscious of Cape Creus on the horizon to leeward. He looked keenly round him, at the Pluto to leeward, veiled in spray, and the Caligula far to windward and her canvas only rarely visible across the tossing grey water. Then it happened—a sudden howling squall, which laid the Sutherland over and then veered round with astonishing quickness. Hornblower clung to the mizzen weather rigging, bellowing orders.',\n",
       " 'It was wild while it lasted; for a moment it felt as if the Sutherland would never rise again, and then as if she might be driven under stern–foremost as the wind took her aback. It howled and shrieked round them with a violence which it had not yet displayed. Only after a long struggle was the ship brought to the wind again and hove to; the shift in the wind had made the sea lumpier and more erratic than ever, so that she was bucking and plunging in a senseless fashion which made it hard even for those who had spent a lifetime at sea to keep their footing. But not a spar had carried away, and not a rope had parted—clear proof of the efficient work of Plymouth Dockyard and of the seamanship of Bush and Harrison. Bush was shouting something now, and pointing away over the quarter, and Hornblower followed the gesture with his eyes. The Pluto had vanished, and for a moment Hornblower thought she must have sunk with all hands.',\n",
       " 'Then a breaking wave revealed her, right over on her beam ends, the grey waves breaking clean over her exposed bottom, her yards pointing to the sky, sails and rigging showing momentarily black through the white foam in the lee of her. “The poor devils have gone!” “Set the main topmast stays’l again!” yelled Hornblower back. She had not sunk yet; there might possibly be some survivors, who might live long enough in the wild sea to grab a rope’s end from the Sutherland’s deck and who might be hauled on board without being beaten to death; it had to be tried even though it was a hundred to one against one of the thousand men on board being saved. Hornblower worked the Sutherland slowly over towards the Pluto. Still the latter lived, with the waves breaking over her as if she were a half–tide rock. Hornblower’s imagination pictured what was happening on board—the decks nearly vertical, with everything carrying away and smashing which could.',\n",
       " 'On the weather side the guns would be hanging by their breechings; the least unsoundness there and they would fall straight down the decks, to smash holes on the opposite side which would sink her in a flash. Men would be crawling about in the darkness below decks; on the main deck the men who had not been washed away would be clinging on like flies on a windowpane, soused under as the waves broke. Through his levelled glass he caught sight of a speck on the exposed upper side of the Pluto, a speck that moved, a speck which survived the breach of a wave over it. There were other specks, too, and there was a gleam of something in swift regular movement. Some gallant soul had got a party together to hack at the weather shrouds of the main mast, and as the Sutherland closed he saw the shrouds part, and the foremast shrouds as well.',\n",
       " 'With a shuddering roll the Pluto heaved herself out of the water like a whale, water cascading from her scuppers, and as she rolled towards the Sutherland her mizzen mast went as well, on the opposite side. Freed from the overpowering leverage of her top hamper she had managed to recover—naval discipline and courage had won her a further chance of life during the few seconds which had been granted her while she lay on her beam ends. Hornblower could see men still hard at work, hacking madly at the uncut shrouds to free the ship from the wreckage thrashing alongside. Her masts had gone, a few feet from the deck; even her bowsprit had disappeared. And with the loss of their steadying weight the bare hull was rolling insanely, heaving right over until her bottom copper was exposed on one side, and then rolling equally far back again, taking only a few seconds to accomplish a roll which extended through far more than a right angle.',\n",
       " 'The wonder was that she did not roll over and over, as a wooden ninepin might do, floating on its side. Inside the ship it must be like an inferno, like a madman’s nightmare; and yet she lived, she floated, with some at least of her crew alive on her decks. Even westward, to leeward, there was a gap visible through the clouds, and the Spanish sun was trying to break through. It was the last hurricane effort of the storm which had done the damage. And yet that last effort must have endured longer than Hornblower could have guessed. He was suddenly conscious of Cape Creus large upon the horizon, and the wind was driving nearly straight from the ships towards it. It would only be a matter of an hour or two before the dismasted hulk was in the shallows at the foot of the cape where certain destruction awaited her—and to make it doubly certain there were French guns on Cape Creus ready to pound a helpless target.',\n",
       " 'In that boiling sea, on a lee shore, the Sutherland would find it difficult to give assistance to a mastless hulk twice her size. Bush, I want the bower cable got out through a stern port. ” Bush could only look his expostulations—he knew his captain too well to demur openly. But anyone could see that for the Sutherland to attempt the task was to take her into danger probably uselessly. The scheme would be practically impossible from the start, owing to the difficulty of getting the cable to the Pluto as she rolled and lunged, wildly and aimlessly, in the trough. Nevertheless, Bush was gone before Hornblower could do more than read his expression. With that wind steadily thrusting them towards the land every second was of value. With her flat bottom and with all her top hamper exposed to the wind the Sutherland was going off to leeward a good deal faster than the Pluto.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower had to work his ship with the utmost care, fighting his way to windward close–hauled before heaving–to and allowing her to drop back again; there was only the smallest margin to spare. The gale was still blowing strongly, and the least clumsiness in handling, the slightest accident to sail or spar, meant danger. Despite the chill of the wind and the steady rain the Sutherland’s topmen were sweating freely soon, thanks to the constant active exertion demanded of them by their captain, as he backed and filled, worked up to windward and went about, keeping his ship hovering round the dismasted Pluto like a seagull round a bit of wreckage. From below came a steady tramp and thumps and dragging noises as Bush’s party slaved away to haul the ponderous twenty–inch cable aft along the lower gun deck. Now Hornblower was measuring distances with his eye, and gauging the direction of the wind with the utmost care.',\n",
       " 'He could not hope to haul the Pluto bodily out to sea—it was as much as the Sutherland could do to work herself to windward—and all he intended was to tow her aside a trifle to gain advantage of the respite, the additional sea room which would be afforded by avoiding the cape. The wind might drop—probably would—or change, and given time the Pluto’s crew would be able to set up jury masts and get their ship under some sort of control. Cape Creus was nearly due west, and the wind was a little north of east, the tiniest trifle north. It would be best from that point of view to drag the Pluto away southerly; in that case they stood a better chance of weathering the cape. But southwards from Cape Creus stretched Rosas Bay, limited southward by Cape Bagur, and such a course might drift them under the guns of Rosas, expose them to the annoyance of the gunboats which were probably stationed there, and end in worse disaster than before.',\n",
       " 'Northwards there would be no such danger; the guns at Llanza could not be remounted yet, and there were twenty miles of clear water from the tip of the cape to Llanza anyway. Northwards was safer—if only he could be sure of weathering the cape. Hornblower’s imagination was hard at work trying to calculate, on quite insufficient data, the rate of drift he could expect and the possible distance the Sutherland would be able to tow the dismasted three–decker in the time granted. With the data insufficient, imagination was all he had to go upon. He had decided on a northward course when a young seaman came running breathless up to the quarterdeck. Bush says the cable’ll be ready in five minutes, sir,” he said. Vincent, signal to the flagship ‘Stand by to receive a line. ” A line! The quarterdeck officers stared at each other. The Pluto was plunging and lunging quite irrationally in the trough of the sea.',\n",
       " 'She was still heeling over so as to show her copper before rolling back to bury the white streaks between her gun ports, but in addition, in the irregular sea, she was lunging now forward, now aft, as incalculable whim took her. She was as dangerous to approach as a gun loose on a rolling deck. Any sort of collision between the ships might well, in that sea, send them both incontinently to the bottom. Hornblower ran his eyes over Brown’s bulging muscles as he stood before him. “I’ve selected you to heave a line to the flagship as we go down past her. D’you know anyone in the ship who could do it better? Frankly, now. ” Brown’s cheerful self–confidence was like a tonic. “What are you going to use, then?” “One o’ them belayin’ pins, sir, an’ a lead line, if I can have one, sir. ” Brown was a man of instant decision—Hornblower’s heart warmed to him, not for the first time. I shall lay our stern as close to the flagship’s bows as is safe.',\n",
       " '” At the moment the Sutherland was forging slowly ahead under storm jib and close–reefed topsails, two hundred yards to windward of the Pluto. Hornblower’s mind became a calculating machine again, estimating the Sutherland’s relative drift down upon the Pluto, the latter’s drunken reelings and plungings, the Sutherland’s present headway, the send of the waves and the chances of a cross–wave intervening. He had to wait for two long minutes before the moment for which he was planning should arrive, his eyes glued upon the Pluto until their relative positions should be exactly what he wanted. Gerard,” said Hornblower—his mind was too busy for him to be afraid. At once the gap between the two ships began to narrow, as the Sutherland drifted down upon the Pluto—a gap of grey angry water with bearded waves. Fortunately the Pluto was lying fairly constantly in the trough without yawing, only surging forward or back as some unexpected sea struck her.',\n",
       " 'Brown was standing statuesquely on the taffrail, balancing superbly. The lead line was coiled on the deck at his side, attached to the belaying pin which he swung pendulum fashion, idly, from his fist. He made a magnificent picture there against the sky, with no hint of nervousness as he watched the distance dwindle. Even at that moment Hornblower felt a hint of envy of Brown’s physique and robust self–confidence. The Sutherland was coming down fast upon the Pluto—upon the latter’s wave–swept forecastle Hornblower could see a group of men waiting anxiously to catch the line. He looked to make sure that Brown’s assistants were ready with a stouter line to bend on the lead line. Gerard was wrong—at the present relative rates of drift the ships would pass at least ten yards further apart than Brown could be expected to throw the belaying pin and its hampering trailer of line. Gerard,” said Hornblower coldly, “back the mizzen tops’l.',\n",
       " '” The hands were ready at the braces; the order was hardly given before it was executed. The Sutherland was making a tiny trifle of sternway now, and the gap was closing farther still. The Pluto’s towering bow, lifting to a wave, seemed right upon them. Gerard and Crystal were swearing softly in unison, without the slightest idea of what they were saying, as they watched, fascinated. Hornblower felt the wind blowing cold about his shoulders. He wanted to call to Brown to throw, and with difficulty checked himself. Then he threw, with the Sutherland’s stern lifting to a wave. The belaying pin flew with the line wavering behind it in the wind. It just reached the Pluto’s beak–head bows and caught round a remnant of the standing rigging of the bowsprit, where a ragged sailor astride the spar seized it with a wave of his arm. Next moment a wave broke clean over him, but he held on, and they saw him pass the end of the line up to the waiting group on the forecastle.',\n",
       " '” The line was uncoiling fast from the deck as the Pluto hauled it in; soon the heavier line was on its way out to the dismasted ship. But they had not long to spare; with their different rates of drift it was impossible for Hornblower in that gale to keep the two ships that same distance apart—impossible and dangerous. The Sutherland hove–to and went to leeward faster than the Pluto, close–hauled she forged ahead, and it was Hornblower’s task to combine these two factors so that the increasing distance between the ships was kept down to a minimum—a nice algebraic problem in convergent series which Hornblower had to convert into mental arithmetic and solve in his head. When suddenly the Pluto decided irrationally to rush forward upon the Sutherland he found himself recasting his estimates at the very moment when everyone else was holding his breath and waiting for the collision.',\n",
       " 'Gerard had a couple of parties standing by with spars to try to bear the Pluto off—not that they could have achieved much against her three thousand tons dead weight—and the bight of an old sail filled with hammocks as a fend–off, and there was wild activity on the forecastle of the Pluto as well, but at the very last moment, with blasphemy crackling all round, the dismasted ship suddenly sheered off and everyone breathed again more freely, except Hornblower. If the Pluto could surge in that fashion towards the Sutherland, she could surge away from her also, and if she were to do so while the line was hauling in the twenty–three–inch cable she would part the line for certain and leave the whole business to be done again—and Cape Creus was looming very near now. “‘How can I help?’” “Reply ‘Wait,’” said Hornblower over his shoulder to him; he had actually forgotten the Caligula’s existence. Bolton would be a fool if he came down unnecessarily to leeward, towards a hostile lee shore.',\n",
       " 'A mighty splash over the stern indicated that Bush down below was paying out some of the hawser through the after port so as to provide some slack if the Pluto surged away, but the process might be overdone—it was a hemp cable, which sank in water, and to have out too much would imperil the line which was drawing it in. “Sir!” said Bush’s voice from below through the open port. ” The line was taking the strain now, and the cable was creeping slowly out towards the Pluto like some sea worm. Hornblower watched as it straightened—this was a business demanding calculation as close as any so far. He had to shout his orders for Bush to pay out more cable, or to wait, his eyes on the ships, on the sea, on the wind. The cable was two hundred yards long, but fifty of those lay in the Sutherland herself—the job had to be completed before the ships were a hundred and fifty yards apart.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower only began to feel relieved when he saw the end of the cable curve up out of the sea onto the Pluto’s bows, and a waving of flags told him that the end had been taken inboard and made fast. Hornblower looked at the nearing land, felt the wind on his cheek. His earlier calculations were proving correct, and if they held on this tack they would be drifted into Rosas Bay even if they cleared the land. “Signal to the flagship ‘I am preparing to go about on the other tack. It appeared to him that Hornblower was going to unnecessary trouble and imperilling both ships by this manœuvre—he could see no farther than Cape Creus, only the friendly sea and the dangerous land. With a seaman’s instinct he wanted to get both ships comfortably under control with sea room under their lee, and he did not stop to consider beyond that. He could see the land and feel the wind, and his reaction to these circumstances was instinctive.',\n",
       " 'When the strain comes on the hawser——” Gerard did not need to be told about that. With three thousand tons trailing on her stern the Sutherland would behave unlike any ship the quartermasters had ever steered, and extraordinary and unexpected measures would have to be taken to keep her from flying up into the wind. The bight of it rose slowly out of the sea, straightening like a bar, the water spouting out of it in fountains, while a thunderous creaking below told how the bitts were feeling the strain. Then the cable slackened a trifle, the creaking diminished, and the Sutherland had got the Pluto under way. With every yard they went, and every bit of way the Pluto received, the latter sagged less and less to leeward. As soon as she could answer the helm the strain on the Sutherland’s quartermasters would be eased. Bush came up on the quarterdeck again, his task below completed.',\n",
       " 'He looked at the land, and felt the wind, and his thoughts followed an exact parallel to Gerard’s, but Bush by now never dreamed of doubting his captain’s judgment in a matter of seamanship. His mental state was now that if Hornblower thought it right, it must be so, and there was no need to wonder about it. ” The Pluto was gathering way, and every yard after this that they made in a southerly direction would be a dead loss when they turned northerly. The Sutherland lost way, and the Pluto came steadily forging down upon her. Hornblower could actually see Captain Elliott come running forward to see for himself what was happening. “Have the signal ‘Tack’ bent and ready to send up, Mr. ” The Sutherland gathered speed again—she had just the distance allowed by the slackening of the hawser in which to gather way and go about before the tow began to interfere. Hornblower watched the cable and estimated the speed of the ship through the water.',\n",
       " 'Vincent!” The helm was put down, the yards braced up, with Rayner forward attending to the fore–topmast staysail. She was coming round, her canvas volleying as she came into the wind; on board the Pluto as they read the signal they had the sense to put their own helm down too, and with steerageway upon her she began to come round a little and allow Hornblower a little more room for his manœuvres. Now the Sutherland was over on the opposite tack, and gathering way, but the Pluto was only halfway round. Hornblower watched the tightening cable rising from the sea. Gerard!” The jerk came, and the Sutherland shuddered. The drag of the cable across her stern was doing the most fantastic things to her—Hornblower could hear Gerard volleying orders to the quartermasters at the wheel and down the grating to the men at the relieving tackles below.',\n",
       " 'For one palpitating second it seemed as if she must be dragged back and thrown in irons, but Gerard at the wheel and Bush at the braces and Rayner forward fought her tooth and nail. Shuddering, she paid off again, and the Pluto followed her round. They were over on the other tack at last heading northwards towards the comparative security of the Gulf of the Lion. Hornblower looked at green–topped Cape Creus, close in now, and a little forward of the port beam. It was going to be a very near–run thing, for besides her own natural leeway the Sutherland was being dragged to leeward by the dead weight of the Pluto, and her speed through the water towards safety was diminished by the same dead weight. Hornblower stood with the wind howling round him, his busy mind plunged into calculations of drift and distance again. He looked back at the Pluto, not rolling so badly now that she had way on her.',\n",
       " 'The towrope was at an angle to the length of the Sutherland, and the Pluto was at a further angle to the towrope. He could rely on Elliott to make the most economical use of his helm, but the drag on the Sutherland must be tremendous. He ought to try to get a little more speed out of the Sutherland, but with a full gale blowing it was dangerous to spread any more canvas. If a sail were to split or a spar carry away they would be on the shore in no time. He looked towards the land again, to measure the diminishing distance, and as he looked a warning rose like a ghost out of the sea a cable’s length away. It was a pillar of water six feet high, which rose from the breast of a wave and vanished as quickly and as mysteriously as it had risen. Hornblower could hardly believe he had seen it, but a glance at Crystal’s and Bush’s faces, intentionally immobile, assured him that he had.',\n",
       " 'A cannon ball had plunged into the water there, calling up that splash, although in the high wind he had neither heard the shot nor seen the smoke from the land. The battery on Cape Creus was firing at him, and he was nearly in range. Soon there would be forty–two–pounder balls coming about his ears. On board the Pluto they had managed to attach a block to the top of the stump of the foremast and send up a signal; the fluttering flags could be seen clearly from the Sutherland’s quarterdeck. ’” They must make more speed through the water, there was no doubt about that. It was an interesting problem in chances, but more of the sort to appeal to a player of hazard than a whist player. To set more sail increased the danger to both ships at the same time as it gave them a greater chance of reaching safety.',\n",
       " 'Yet if he set more sail and lost a spar he still might possibly struggle with the Sutherland out of danger, and the Pluto would be no more lost than she would be if he cast her off ignominiously now. Bush, I’ll have the reefs shaken out of the fore tops’l. He had anticipated the necessity for it, and he had guessed that his captain would choose the bolder course—he was learning fast, even at his age, was Bush. The topmen went running up the rigging and out along the fore–topsail yard; standing on the swaying foot ropes with the gale howling round them, holding on by their elbows over the yard, they struggled with the reef points. The sail shook itself out with a loud flap, and the Sutherland heeled sharply over under the increased pressure. Hornblower noticed the flat catenary curve of the heavy cable astern flatten itself a trifle more, but the rope gave no sign of breaking under the strain.',\n",
       " 'Despite the increased heel of the ship the men at the wheel were actually finding their task a little easier, for the leverage of the big fore–topsail forward tended to balance the eternal drag of the tow aft. He glanced at the land just in time to see a puff of smoke from the summit of Cape Creus, blown instantly into invisibility by the gale. Where the shots fell he could not tell at all, for he neither saw nor heard them; the sea was too rough for the splashes to be easily seen. But the fact that the battery was firing showed that they must at least be almost in range—they were circling on the very edge of ruin. Nevertheless, the Sutherland was making better speed through the water, and looking aft he could see preparations advancing on the Pluto’s deck for setting up a jury main mast. Any fragment of sail which the Pluto could carry would ease the Sutherland’s task enormously, and in an hour they might have the work completed.',\n",
       " 'Yet in an hour darkness would come to shield them from the fire of the battery; in an hour their fate would be decided one way or another. Everything depended on the occurrences of the next hour. The sun had broken through the westerly clouds now, changing the hills and mountains of Spain from grey to gold. Hornblower nerved himself to endure the waiting during the next hour, and the Sutherland and the Pluto came through that hour successfully. At the end of that time they had weathered Cape Creus, and had drawn so far to the northward that the land under their lee had dropped away abruptly from a mile and a half distant to fifteen miles.',\n",
       " 'Chapter XVII “CAPTAIN HORNBLOWER will command the landing party,” said Admiral Leighton, finally. Elliott and Bolton both nodded in entire agreement as they sat round the council table in the Pluto’s cabin. A landing party six hundred strong, contributed by three ships of the line, was certainly a captain’s command, and Hornblower was equally certainly the best captain to command it. They had been expecting some such move as this ever since the Pluto had returned refitted from Port Mahon, and Leighton had shifted his flag back into her from the Caligula. The coming and going of Colonel Villena from the shore had heralded it, too. For three weeks the Caligula and the Sutherland had ranged along the coast of Catalonia, and the Pluto returning had brought back welcome fresh provisions, the Sutherland’s prize crews, and even a dozen new hands for each ship.',\n",
       " 'With the ships at full strength they might well strike a heavy blow, and the capture of Rosas, if it could be effected, would undoubtedly throw the whole of the French arrangements for the subjection of Catalonia into confusion. “Captain Hornblower?” Hornblower looked round the big cabin, the cushioned lockers, the silver on the table, Elliott and Bolton gorged with the vast dinner they had consumed, Sylvester with paper and ink before him, Villena in his gaudy yellow uniform staring idly about while the English conversation which he did not understand went on round him. On the bulkhead opposite him hung a portrait of Lady Barbara, a likeness so good as to be startling—Hornblower felt as if he might hear her voice at any moment. He caught himself wondering what they did with it when they cleared for action, tore his thoughts away from Lady Barbara with an effort, and tried as tactfully as he could to show his distaste for the whole scheme.',\n",
       " '“I think,” he said at length, “that it might be unwise to trust so entirely to the cooperation of the Spanish army. ” “There are seven thousand men ready to march,” said Leighton. ” “Colonel Villena assures me that there are byroads round the town passable to an army without cannon. He himself, as you know, has made the journey four times. Sending a single horseman was a different proposition entirely from marching seven thousand men by mountain paths. “But can we be certain of seven thousand men? And can we be sure that they will come?” “Four thousand men would suffice for the siege,” said Leighton. “And I have General Rovira’s definite promise to march. He realised it was hopeless to try to argue with a man who had not had personal experience of Spanish promises, and who had not imagination enough to visualise the difficulties of arranging combined action between forces separated by thirty miles of mountainous country. The telltale groove had appeared between Leighton’s eyebrows.',\n",
       " '“What alternative do you suggest, then, Captain Hornblower?” he asked, impatience evident at having thus to reopen the whole question. “I should suggest that the squadron confine itself to actions within its own strength, without having to depend on Spanish help. Why not try that? Six hundred men ought to be able to storm it. ” “My instructions,” said Leighton ponderously, “are to the effect that I must act in the closest cooperation with the Spanish forces. Rosas has a garrison of no more than two thousand men, and Rovira has seven thousand only thirty miles away. The main body of the French Seventh Corps is to the southward of Barcelona—we have a week at least in which to effect something against Rosas. From the squadron we can supply heavy guns, men to work them, and more men to head a storming column when we have effected a breach. It appears to me to be an eminently suitable opportunity for combined action, and I quite fail to understand your objections, Captain Hornblower.',\n",
       " 'But perhaps they are not so cogent, now?” “I did no more than to state them at your request, sir. ” “I did not ask for objections, but for comments, or helpful suggestions. I looked for more loyalty from you, Captain Hornblower. If Leighton only wanted servile agreement there was no sense in continuing. He had clearly made up his mind, and on the face of it he had a very strong case. Hornblower knew that his objections were more instinctive than reasoned, and a captain could not very well put forward the plea of greater experience to an admiral. Captain Bolton? Captain Elliott? No comments? Then we can start work at once. I trust that we are on the eve of the most resounding success the east coast of Spain has seen since this Spanish war began. ” The fall of Rosas would indeed be a resounding success if it could be achieved.',\n",
       " 'As a town with practicable communication with the sea it could hardly be retaken by the French now that there was a strong English squadron on the spot to sustain it. It would be a constant threat to the French communications, a base where Spanish armies from anywhere in the Peninsula could be thrown on shore, of such importance that the Seventh Corps would be bound to cease their attempts at the conquest of Catalonia and concentrate all their strength on the task of retaking it or observing it. But it was Spanish information that there was no French field army within reach. It was a Spanish promise to bring Rovira down from Olot to effect a siege, and a Spanish promise to have transport animals ready to drag the siege train from the landing point. But with Leighton set upon it, there was nothing for it but to go through with the affair wholeheartedly.',\n",
       " 'If everything went right, they would win a great success, and although Hornblower had never yet heard of a combined operation of war in which everything went right, he could still hope for one, and draft his arrangements for the landing of the siege train from the fleet in accordance with that hope. Two nights later the squadron came gliding in the early darkness, with the hills and cliffs of the Cape Creus peninsula looming faintly in the distance, to drop anchor together off the sandy cove beside Selva de Mar which had been agreed upon as the best place for landing. Four miles to the westward was the battery at Llanza; five miles to the east was the battery on the end of Cape Creus, and six miles due southward, across the root of the long peninsula of which Cape Creus forms the tip, lay the town of Rosas. “Good luck, sir,” said Bush, looming up in the darkness of the quarterdeck as Hornblower made ready to go down into his barge.',\n",
       " '” could be dropped occasionally in unofficial speeches of this sort. But the fact that he found his hand sought and gripped by Bush’s large horny one was an indication that Bush took the most serious view of the impending operation. The barge took him quickly over the placid water which reflected the numberless stars overhead; soon the noise of the gentle waves breaking on the sandy beach was louder than the subdued rumbling of the landing force in process of embarkation. A sharp challenge came from the beach to the approaching boat; it was pleasant to hear that it was worded in Spanish, which made it appear much less likely that it was a French force posted there to oppose a landing, and probable that it was the party of guerrilleros who had been promised. Hornblower stepped ashore, and a group of cloaked figures, just visible in the starlight, came down the beach towards him. “The English captain?” asked one of them in Spanish.',\n",
       " '” “I am Colonel Juan Claros, of the third tercio of Catalan migueletes. ” “How many animals?” “Fifty horses and a hundred mules. ” Villena had promised that all northern Catalonia would be swept for draught animals for the siege train. There were four miles of hill paths and a mile of flat plain to be covered between here and Rosas—it would take fifty horses to drag one of the two and a half ton twenty–four–pounders over rough country. Had there been fewer animals than this Hornblower would have refused to move, but the Spaniards had provided the barest minimum necessary. “Where is Colonel Rovira?” “He is over beyond Castellon, closing in on Rosas. ” “What is his force?” “He has every Spaniard able to carry arms in northern Catalonia, Captain, except for my tercio. The army was to be under the walls at dawn, and to be joined as quickly as possible by the siege train, so that the battering could start without delay immediately upon the alarm being given.',\n",
       " 'There was only the barest minimum of time available to reduce Rosas before the main French army could come up from Barcelona. Hornblower felt that he must make every effort to carry out his part of the programme, since the Spaniards were adhering so closely to theirs. “Have you any patrol watching Rosas?” asked Hornblower. They will give the alarm if any sortie comes from the fortress. ” He would not be able to get the guns far from the beach before dawn, and by that time Rovira would have hemmed Rosas in, while any hitch would be reported by the cavalry. Hornblower felt he had misjudged the Spaniards, or perhaps these Catalan irregulars were better soldiers than the ordinary Spanish army—which was not unlikely. The steady splash of oars heralded the approach of the boats of the squadron; the leading ones were up to the beach and the men in them came tumbling out, stirring up a faint phosphorescence in the water.',\n",
       " 'The white cross–belts of the marines showed up in startling contrast with their red coats, which appeared black in the faint light. “Major Laird!” “Sir!” “Take a party to the top of the cliff. Post your pickets where you think best, but remember your orders. ” Hornblower wanted to have a solid disciplined force out as a screen in front of him, not trusting Spanish precautions against surprise, but in darkness, with three languages—Spanish, Catalan, and English—in use, he did not want to risk any muddle or misunderstanding. It was the sort of minor technical difficulty which could not be appreciated by an admiral without experience. The longboats with the guns were grounding far out in the shallows. Men were already hauling into position the rough landing pontoon of spars lashed into rafts, the outer sections buoyed up by casks, which Hornblower had had prepared.',\n",
       " 'Cavendish, the first lieutenant of the Pluto, was doing this part of the work thoroughly well and without troubling Hornblower for orders. “Where are the horses and mules, Colonel?” “Up above. ” It was only a matter of minutes for most of the material to be brought ashore, even though a thousand rounds of shot for the twenty–four–pounders—a hundred rounds per gun, one day’s consumption—weighed over ten tons. Three hundred seamen and three hundred marines, working under naval discipline, could land ten tons of shot, and the necessary powder barrels, and the beef and bread for one day’s rations, in no time worth mentioning. It was the guns which presented the greatest difficulty. The first of the ten twenty–four–pounders was only now being coaxed onto the pontoon, for it was a desperate business to run it up the brief ramp from the platform built on the thwarts, where it had been precariously perched during its passage from the ship, over the boat’s gunwale.',\n",
       " 'The pontoon sank under its ponderous weight until its surface was awash. Two hundred men, thigh–deep in water, tailed onto the dragropes which were attached to the gun, and, floundering and splashing, their feet seeking foothold in the soft sand below and finding none, they gradually hauled the thing towards the beach. Like all guns Hornblower had ever seen, it behaved with a pigheaded obstinacy that might have been instigated by infernal powers with a perverted sense of humour. Although it had been fitted, by Hornblower’s orders, with specially large trucks to make it more easy to surmount inequalities of surface, it caught and stuck, over and over again, in its passage over the spars. Handspikes and crowbars were handled diligently in the dark by Cavendish and his men to coax it over the inequalities.',\n",
       " 'And then it would slew round, with Cavendish bellowing to the men to avast, for fear lest the maddening thing should run clean off the platform into the water alongside; only when it had been pushed and heaved straight again could the men tail onto the dragropes once more. There were ten of these guns, Hornblower reflected, and four miles of paths, uphill and down, over which they had to be dragged. He had had the base of the pier prolonged over the sand by further rafts of timber laid out there, right up to where the sand gave place to the rocky bottom of the steep combe which seamed the cliff here and led to the summit. The horses and mules, each with a man at its head whose rags were obvious in the darkness, were waiting here in a great herd, but of course the Spaniards, although they knew they had come to drag guns, had provided no sort of harness for the operation. “Here, you men,” said Hornblower, turning to a waiting group of sailors.',\n",
       " '” It was quite fantastic to see what seamen could turn their hands to. The English words they used may have sounded strange to the Spanish horses’ ears as they wheeled the animals into position, but they seemed to be effective enough. Even the horse–holders, gabbling Catalan, pushed and shoved until they were more help than hindrance. Whinnying and clattering in the darkness—barely relieved by the light of a dozen lanterns—the puzzled brutes were got into line. Rope collars padded with canvas were slipped over their heads, rope traces were passed back to the eyebolts in the gun carriage. “Avast!” roared one of the sailors just as the strain was beginning to come on. “This beggar’s got his starboard leg over the line!” By the time the second gun had reached the water’s edge they were ready to start hauling up the first. The horses plunged as they sought foothold in the sand, but the gun began to move, with a vast creaking and crackling of timber under the trucks.',\n",
       " 'The movement was spasmodic and jerky, and when they began to breast the steep slope of the combe it died away altogether. Twenty Spanish horses, underfed and undersized, could not haul that gun up the slope. ” A hundred men on dragropes as well as twenty horses managed it, aided by a party behind with crowbars to help over the worst inequalities and to sprag the wheels with rocks at moments when neither men nor horses could pull for another second. Hornblower felt he had really accomplished a great deal when he stood on the summit, with dawn creeping out of the sea, and looked at the line of ten guns, and the mountain of stores, which had been all dragged up in the course of the night. The gradual coming of the light enabled him to look about him. Down below was the golden beach, dotted with details of the landing party, and beyond that the blue sea, with the ships of the squadron rolling to their anchors.',\n",
       " 'On his own level the summit of the peninsula stretched in a rocky uneven expanse before him. Over to his right the rock broke completely through in a vast table–topped hill, but southward, in the direction of Rosas, which he would have to follow, a narrow goat path wound through the low scrub of arbutus bushes. Claros beside him was revealed as a lean man, sunburnt to the colour of tobacco, with a long black moustache above an excellent set of white teeth, which he displayed in a smile. ” There were a few brown figures creeping dispiritedly about the rocks; in the dips between the low crests there were brown masses which were just beginning to disintegrate in the sunlight from huddles of sleeping men into sleepy groups, who, still clutching their blankets about them, moved aimlessly here and there. Hornblower regarded his allies with a disfavour which was not diminished by the fact that it was exactly what he had anticipated, and which was intensified by his sleepless night.',\n",
       " '“Would you be so kind,” he said, “as to send a message to Colonel Rovira, telling him that we are about to march on Rosas, and that I hope to reach there with at least some of the guns at noon?” “Certainly, Captain. ” “And I must ask you for the help of your men in the transport of my guns and stores. ” Claros looked more dubious at that, and more dubious still when he was told that of his men four hundred would be needed to help with the guns while another four hundred would have to carry a twenty–four–pound cannon ball each all the way to Rosas. Hornblower overrode his objections a little crossly. “And after that, Colonel,” he said, “they will have to return here for more. I was promised a sufficiency of pack animals; if you do not supply me with four–legged ones, I must use those with two. Now, if you please, I want to get the column started. ” Ten horses or mules to every gun, with a hundred men at the dragropes.',\n",
       " 'A hundred men ahead to labour on the task of improving the path, rolling rocks out of the way and filling up holes. Four hundred men carrying cannon balls, some of them leading the pack mules with gunpowder kegs slung over their backs. Claros looked still more askance when it became apparent that every man of his tercio would be at work, while Hornblower proposed to leave two hundred of his marines free of any labouring duty. If you do not like it, you can try to find a Spanish battering train. ” Hornblower was determined upon keeping a substantial portion of his disciplined force closed up and ready for an emergency, and his determination was obvious enough to silence Claros’ protests. There was already an outcry behind them when the mules were being loaded up. Hornblower strode over with Claros at his heels, to find a Spanish officer threatening Gray with a drawn sword, his ragged guerrilleros behind him handling their muskets.',\n",
       " '“What’s all this? What is happening here?” demanded Hornblower, first in English and then in Spanish. Everybody turned to him all speaking at once, like schoolboys in a playground dispute. The officer’s explosive Catalan was almost incomprehensible to him, and he turned to listen to Gray. “It’s like this, sir,” said the master’s mate, displaying a lighted cigar in his hand. “This Dago lieutenant here, sir, he was a–smoking this while we was loading up the mules. I says to him, very respectful, sir, ‘No smoking in the magazine, sir,’ but he didn’t take no notice, not understanding, maybe. So I says to him, I says, ‘No smokingo, magazino, senor,’ an’ he just blew out a puff of smoke and turned his back on me. So I took away his cigar, an’ he drew his sword, sir. ” Claros had at the same time heard his officer’s explanation, and Claros and Hornblower faced each other. “Your officer has been very foolish,” said Hornblower.',\n",
       " 'He pointed to one of the barrels swinging against the ribs of the patient mule who bore it. It was slightly stove, and a thin black trickle of powder had run from it. There was powder on the mule’s flank, powder on the ground. The danger of fire was obvious, must be obvious even to a Catalan. Claros could not suppress a half smile as he looked. “My sailor acted hastily,” said Hornblower, “but I think you will admit, Colonel, that he was in part justified. He will tender a profound apology, and then, perhaps, you will issue strict orders against smoking near the powder. “Say to the officer, ‘God save our gracious King, senor. ” “God save our gracious king, senor,” said Gray, in a tone that was at least unnatural, if not humble. “The man wishes to express to you his profound regret for his rudeness,” explained Hornblower to the officer, and Claros nodded approvingly, spat out a couple of brief orders, and turned away. The crisis was over, and no feelings hurt on either side.',\n",
       " 'The sailors were grinning and cheerful, while the Catalans looked proudly down upon the lighthearted barbarians.',\n",
       " 'Chapter XVIII CAPTAIN HORNBLOWER checked his horse on the top of the last of the hitherto interminable rocky undulations. The August sun was blazing overhead, and innumerable flies plagued him and his horse and his companions. At his side rode Claros, behind them Longley and Brown sat uneasily their rawboned Rosinantes along with the three Spanish staff officers. Far back along the path was a solid block of scarlet, where Major Laird had his marines formed up as an advanced guard, while here and there on the grey–green hills scarlet dots showed where he had posted pickets as a precaution against surprise. Farther back still could be seen a caterpillar of men, naked to the waist, labouring at their task of improving the path for the guns, and beyond that a sort of multiple caterpillar with a black dot at the end showed where the first gun had reached. In five hours it had travelled little more than three miles.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower, looking up at the sun, saw that he had an hour and a half left in which to keep his appointment—in which to haul his guns over a mile of rock and over a mile of the plain which lay below him. He felt a twinge of conscience at the thought that he would probably be a little late with the first of the guns, and he certainly would not be able to open fire against the walls before five or six o’clock in the evening. There below him, a mile away but seemingly much nearer in the clear air, lay the town of Rosas. Hornblower could recognise all the features of the place which his map indicated. To the right was the citadel—from his elevated position Hornblower could see the pentagonal outline of its grey ramparts, with the blue sea behind. In the centre was the town itself, a single long street lying close to the shore, with a line of earthworks guarding it on the landward side. To the left was the high tower of Fort Trinidad on the other flank.',\n",
       " 'The weakest point was undoubtedly the centre, but it would be of little use assailing that, as the citadel and the Trinidad could hold out independently. The best course would be to take the bull by the horns and breach and storm the citadel by an attack delivered from close by the water’s edge. The town could not be held if the citadel fell, although the Trinidad might cause further trouble. Hornblower had allowed his thoughts to run away with him. He had been so busy planning the reduction of Rosas that he had not even noticed the general peacefulness of the scene. The tri–coloured flags flapped idly from the flagstaffs in the citadel and the Trinidad, and they were the most warlike things in sight. There was no sign on the bare plain of any besieging army. Meanwhile it could only be a question of hours before the garrison discovered how near to them lay a valuable convoy, and how weak was the force guarding it. “Where is the army of Catalonia?” Hornblower demanded angrily, of Claros.',\n",
       " '” To Hornblower it meant that his precious convoy, and his far more precious landing party, were strung out over three miles of country within easy reach of any column which the governor of Rosas might send out. “You told me Colonel Rovira was marching on Rosas last night!” “He seems to have been delayed. ” “The messenger—the one you said you would send at dawn—has he returned?” Claros, by a raising of his eyebrows and a jerk of the head, passed this question on to the chief of staff. He had to fight down his bewilderment and struggle with his dazed senses in order to speak Spanish again. “Why not?” “It would have put the officer to unnecessary trouble,” said the chief of staff. In a fold of the hills a line of some fifty picketed horses and a few groups of seated men indicated the position of the squadron of cavalry which had been watching the town since yesterday. “Why did they not report that Colonel Rovira had not arrived?” he demanded.',\n",
       " '“The officer commanding had my orders to report when he did arrive,” answered Claros. He was showing no signs of indignation at the barely concealed contempt in Hornblower’s expression, but Hornblower kept his rage in hand for a little longer in his endeavour to keep the enterprise alive. “We are in a very considerable danger here,” he said. Claros shrugged his shoulders again at the Englishman’s timidity. If the garrison comes out to attack us we can get away by goat paths over there,” he answered, pointing away to the precipitous sides of the mesa in the distance. “They will never dare to follow us there, and if they did they would never catch us. ” “But my guns? My men?” “In war there is always danger,” said Claros, loftily. Nothing is to move a yard farther without orders from me. ” Longley wheeled his horse round and clattered off; the boy had somewhere learned to ride well before coming to sea.',\n",
       " 'Claros and his staff, Hornblower and Brown, all watched him go, and then turned back to face each other. The Spaniards could guess what were the orders that had been given him. “Not a gun or a man of mine will stir,” said Hornblower, “until I see Colonel Rovira’s army on the plain there. Will you be good enough to send a message to him now?” Claros tugged at his long moustache and then gave the order to his staff; his junior officers argued sulkily with each other before one of them took the note written by the chief of staff and set off with it. Clearly no one relished the prospect of a ride of perhaps twenty miles under a hot sun in search of Rovira’s column. “Will you have my men’s food served out to them, Captain?” Hornblower’s jaw dropped at that. He had thought nothing more could surprise him, and he was proved wrong.',\n",
       " 'Claros tobacco–brown face gave no indication that he thought there was anything other than what was strictly ordinary in his assumption that his thousand men were to feed on the stores laboriously landed from the squadron. It was on the tip of Hornblower’s tongue to refuse pointblank, but he stopped to consider. He guessed that if they were not fed, Claros’ men would simply melt away in search of food, and there was still a faint chance that Rovira might arrive and the siege be taken in hand. For the sake of that chance, it was as well to make this concession and make the most of the few hours granted them before their presence should be discovered. “I will give orders for it,” he said, and the dignified colonel’s expression showed no change at either demanding or receiving favours from the Englishman with whom he had just been on the verge of quarrelling. Soon sailors and Catalans were all of them eating heartily.',\n",
       " 'Even the squadron of cavalry smelt food from afar, like vultures, and rode hastily back to join in the feast, leaving only an unhappy half dozen to continue the watch over Rosas. Claros and his staff seated themselves in a group ministered to by orderlies. And as was to be expected, comida was followed by siesta—after a vast meal every Spaniard stretched himself in the shade which the scrub afforded, and snored, flat on his back, with a Peninsular disregard for the flies which buzzed over his open mouth. He dismounted and gave his horse over into Brown’s charge, and then hobbled up and down on his hilltop looking down at Rosas, with his heart full of bitterness. He had written carefully to the admiral to explain the reason of his halt—carefully, because he did not want to appear to belong to the type of officer who sees difficulties at every turn—and the answer had simply enraged him.',\n",
       " 'Was it not possible, Leighton had asked in his reply, to attempt something against the fortress with the fifteen hundred men he had in hand? Where was General Rovira? The tone of that question indicated that Hornblower was somehow at fault regarding Rovira’s nonarrival. Captain Hornblower must remember the need to work in the closest and most cordial cooperation with England’s allies. The squadron could not possibly continue to supply Claros’ force with food for long; Hornblower must tactfully call Colonel Claros’ attention to the need for drawing upon his own sources of supplies. It was highly important that the arrival of the British squadron should be signalised by a great success, but on no account was any operation to be undertaken which might imperil the safety of the landing party. Leighton’s letter was a completely futile piece of writing, having regard for the present facts, but a Court of Inquiry who knew none of them would consider it eminently sane and sensible.',\n",
       " 'There were three serpents issuing out of the fortress—three long narrow columns of troops creeping out onto the plain, one each from the citadel, the village, and the Trinidad. A hoarse shout from the Spanish cavalry picket proclaimed that they had seen the same phenomenon; the little party left their post and rode headlong back to the scattered Spanish army. Hornblower went on staring for two more minutes; the columns showed no sign of ending, but wound on interminably out of the fortifications. Two were heading towards him, while the one from the citadel was taking a different route, off to his right, with the clear intention of cutting off the Spanish retreat to the mainland. Hornblower’s eye caught the flash of musket barrels in the sunlight; still the columns were winding out—there must be a thousand men at least in each. The Spanish information which had estimated the garrison’s strength as two thousand as a maximum must be as faulty as all the rest.',\n",
       " 'Claros came clattering up with his staff to gaze out over the plain. He paused only for an instant to take in the significance of what he saw—every man with him pointed simultaneously to the outflanking column—and then he wheeled about and spurred back again. As he wheeled his eyes met Hornblower’s; they were expressionless as ever, but Hornblower knew what he intended. If he abandoned the convoy and marched his men with all haste for the mesa, he could just get away in time, and he was set upon it. Hornblower knew in that instant that there was not the least use appealing to him to cover the retreat of the convoy, even if the Catalans were steady enough to fight a rearguard action against greatly superior numbers. The safety of the landing party was dependent solely on its own exertions, and there was not a moment to be lost.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower scrambled onto his horse—the heads of the French columns were well out onto the plain now, and some would be soon ascending the steep escarpment of the plateau—and dashed back after Claros. Then, as he neared the place where Major Laird had his marines already drawn up into line, he checked the pace of his weary horse to a sober trot. It would never do to display too much haste or anxiety. The obvious best course was to abandon everything, guns, stores, and all, and march his men back to the ships headlong. The lives of trained seamen were too valuable to be lightly thrown away, and if he did as common sense directed he would have every man safely on board before the French column caught them up; in any matter–of–fact scale of relative values even a few seamen were worth more than ten twenty–four–pounders, and their ammunition and whatever foodstuffs had been landed. Yet in war the matter–of–fact frequently held only second place.',\n",
       " 'A headlong flight to the ships, and abandonment of guns and stores, would depress the spirits of the men inordinately; a fighting retreat with next to no loss would raise them. He made up his mind as he halted his horse beside Major Laird. “We’ll have three thousand French on us in an hour, Laird,” he said quietly. “You’ll have to hold them back while we get the stores on board again. He was a tall red–faced Scot, red–haired and inclined to stoutness; his cocked hat was tilted back off his forehead and he mopped his face with a lilac–coloured silk handkerchief which clashed dreadfully in the sunlight with his red coat and sash. ” Hornblower spared a second to glance down the double lines of marines, the homely brown faces under the shakos, and the white cross–belts in Euclidean line. The disciplined composure the marines displayed was comforting and reassuring. He kicked his heels into the shaggy sides of his horse and trotted down the path.',\n",
       " 'Tell the admiral it is necessary to reembark the men and stores, and ask that all the boats of the squadron should be ready to take us off. ” A column of Spaniards was already hurrying off in disorderly fashion up a cross path towards the mainland. A Spanish officer was collecting the remainder of his men; a British petty officer was looking on in puzzled fashion as they unhitched a team of horses from one of the guns and began to lead them away. “Stop!” shouted Hornblower, riding up in the nick of time and delving hurriedly into his mind for adequate Spanish. Tell every officer that the Spaniards can go, but they’re not to take a mule or horse with them. In a country in whose every corner war had raged bitterly for two years draught and pack animals were of the utmost imaginable value. The meanest Spanish peasant in the ranks knew it, knew that the loss of those animals would mean an empty belly for him in some new campaign a month off.',\n",
       " 'They handled their pistols and cutlasses with every intention of using them if necessary, and the Spaniards remembered the French column which was marching to cut off their retreat. All down the path they abandoned the animals and drew off, sulkily, while Hornblower kicked his weary horse into renewed activity, as he rode along, turning back towards the beach all the guns and material which had been dragged so far with such exertion. He reached the head of the steep gully and rode down it to the beach. On that tranquil afternoon the sea was blue and smooth like enamel; far out the squadron rode peacefully at anchor, and below him lay the golden sand of the beach, while over the enamelled surface plied the boats of the squadron like huge beetles. All round him grasshoppers were singing deafeningly. The beach party was already hard at work reembarking the beef barrels and bread bags piled there.',\n",
       " 'He could safely leave this part of the work to Cavendish, and he turned back again and rode up the gully. At the top a party of seamen arrived with the first of the mule train. He left orders for the animals to be brought back to the guns as soon as their loads were taken off, and rode on. The nearest gun was within half a mile of the gully, men and horses labouring to drag it up the path—for this half mile the land sloped away fairly steeply inland from the top of the cliffs. The men gave him a cheer, and he waved his hand and tried to sit his horse as if he were an accomplished rider; it was comforting to think that Brown behind him was an even worse horseman, so that the contrast might help. Then a distant pop–pop–popping, its tone unnatural in the heated air, told him that Laird’s rearguard was in action. He rode hastily along the path, Brown and Longley at his heels, past the other gun teams labouring on the steep hillsides, towards the firing.',\n",
       " 'At one point along the path there was a long line of cannon balls, lying where the Spanish carrying party had dropped them when the alarm came. Those would have to be lost—there was no chance at all of getting them back to the ships. Here the country was a succession of short steep ups and downs, the rocky soil covered with a dense undergrowth, amid which grasshoppers were still singing loudly through the musketry. Laird had his men strung out along the summit of one of the major ridges; Hornblower came upon him standing on a lump of rock overlooking the path, the lilac handkerchief still in one hand and his sword in the other, and muskets banging away all along the ridge on either side of him. He had the air of a man completely enjoying himself, and he looked down at Hornblower with the irritation of a man disturbed while composing a work of art. “Aye,” said Laird, and then, grudgingly, “come up and see for yourself.',\n",
       " '” Hornblower got off his horse and scrambled up the rock, balancing precariously on its slippery summit beside the major. “Ye’ll observe,” said Laird, academically, and rolling his r’s, “that formed troops must keep to the paths in this terrain. Moreover, detached skirmishes lose their sense of direction rapidly, and this thorny vegetation is admirably adapted to hinder free movement. ” From the rock Hornblower looked down upon a sea of green—the nearly impenetrable maquis which clothes the stony hillsides of Mediterranean Spain—through which the red coats of the marines, shoulder–deep in the scrub, were hardly visible. Here and there puffs of white smoke, drifting over the surface, marked where recently there had been firing. On the opposite hillside there were other puffs of smoke and faint stirrings among the undergrowth. Hornblower saw white faces, and blue coats, and sometimes even white breeches over there where the French struggled through the thorny scrub.',\n",
       " 'Much farther back he could see part of a column of troops waiting on a section of the path. Two or three musket bullets came buzzing through the air close over his head. “We are quite safe here,” said Laird, “until the enemy turns our flank. If ye look over there to the right, ye’ll observe a French regiment advancing along a path roughly parallel to this one. As soon as it reaches that thorn tree there, we shall have to retreat and take up a fresh position and leave them all their work to do again. Fortunately that path is only a sheep track of uncertain direction. ” Hornblower could see a long line of French shakos bobbing along above the maquis as he followed Laird’s pointing finger; its loops and winds showed that the path must be, as Laird had suggested, a mere chance sheep track. “The French standard of musketry,” said Laird, “is lower now even than it was at Maida, where I had the honour of being engaged as an officer on Sir John Stuart’s staff.',\n",
       " 'Those fellows have been firing at me for half an hour now without hitting me, nor even with the remotest chance of hitting me. But with two of us up here the possibility is doubled. I would recommend you, sir, to descend and devote your attention to accelerating the march of the convoy. Hornblower knew quite well that the command of the rearguard was Laird’s duty, in which he should not interfere as long as it was properly performed. It was the fear of being thought afraid which made him hesitate to descend. As he stood, he felt his cocked hat struck a violent blow which twisted it on his head so that it toppled off; with an instinctive grab he caught it as it fell. “That outflanking column,” said Laird, steadily, “is about to reach the thorn tree. I must ask you officially, sir”—he dragged out the long word into “offeeecially”—“to go back before I call on my men to retreat.',\n",
       " '” “Very well, Major,” said Hornblower, grinning despite himself, and slipping down from the rock with all the dignity he could muster. He got on his horse and trotted down the path again; he examined his hat with a little thrill of pride to see that the bullet had hit the gold loop at the front, passing within two inches of his head, and he had felt no fear. Where the path crossed the summit of the next ridge he drew rein again; the musketry in the rear had suddenly became more intense. He waited, and then a detachment of marines came running along the path with Captain Morris at their head. They had no attention to spare for him as they turned aside and plunged into the undergrowth on either side of the path, seeking points of vantage from which their fire would cover the retreat of their comrades.',\n",
       " 'The musketry fire spluttered out abruptly, and then up the path they came, Laird at their head, half a dozen men under a young lieutenant bringing up the rear and turning to keep back the nearest enemy with warning shots. Confident that the rearguard was under efficient direction, Hornblower was able to ride on to where the rearmost gun was standing stubbornly at the foot of a slope. The weary horses were plunging and slipping on the rocky surface as they strove to drag the thing up under the urgings of the sailors, but now there were only half a dozen seamen in place of the fifty Spaniards who had helped to drag it from the beach. They were reduced to heaving the gun up the slope foot by foot with crowbars; their naked ribs—most of them had thrown off their shirts—were glistening with sweat. Hornblower racked his brains for the appropriate thing to say. ” The column of Spaniards could now be seen like a long worm ascending the precipitous sides of the mesa.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower, looking after them, felt a sudden feeling of hatred for them and the race they represented. They were a proud nation, yet never so proud as to disdain favours from others, hating foreigners only a little more than they hated each other, ignorant, misgoverned, misusing the wealth with which nature had endowed their country; Spain was a natural prey to any stronger nation. France had made this attempt at conquest, and it was only England’s jealousy which was defeating it. Sometime in the future the country would be torn to pieces in the strife between Liberals and Conservatives, and at some period in that struggle the European powers would find sufficient accord to seize upon the fragments. Civil war and foreign aggression, centuries of them, perhaps, constituted the future of Spain unless the Spaniards set their house in order.',\n",
       " 'He brought back his mind with an effort from profitless speculation on the future to deal with the petty problems in hand—detailing the returning mule teams to assist in dragging the guns, portioning out the failing strength of his men so as to make the best speed with the mass of material yet remaining; the spluttering musketry to the rear told how men were suffering wounds and death for the sake of preserving it from the enemy. He sternly cast out the doubts which assailed him as to whether the gesture were worth the price, and kicked his exhausted horse into a last effort as he clattered along the path. Half the guns were on the beach at last—for the final run down the steep gully to the sand little exertion was needed—and the remainder was fast nearing the head of the gully. The beach was cleared of all the stores that had been landed, and the first gun was even now being dragged along the landing pier for transfer to the ships.',\n",
       " 'Cavendish, in command at the beach, came up to Hornblower. “What about the horses and mules, sir?” Shipping a hundred and fifty animals would be as difficult a task as shipping the guns, and they would be an intolerable nuisance on board. Certainly they must not be allowed to fall into the hands of the French; in Spain at the present time they were the most valuable form of booty. The sensible thing to do would be to cut the brutes’ throats on the beach. If only they could be got away, and kept alive on board for a few days, they might be landed again and handed back to the Spaniards. To slaughter the wretched beasts would have as bad a moral effect on the men as losing the guns. Crushed biscuit would feed them on board—from the look of them it would be better fare than they had experienced for some time—and the freshwater problem was hardly insurmountable. In the rear Laird was still fighting his successful rearguard action, and the sun was fast setting over the mesa.',\n",
       " '“Send them on board with the other stores,” said Hornblower, at last. “Aye aye, sir,” said Cavendish, allowing no shade of expression in his face to hint at his conviction that mules were far more trouble than guns to coax into small boats and to heave up into the ships. One of the guns, with the malicious ingenuity of all its tribe, fell over and dismounted itself during its passage down the gully, but the men did not allow the accident to delay them long. With crowbars they heaved the huge mass of iron down the slope and over the sand, rolling it, like a barrel, along the pier and into the longboat awaiting it. The ships had tackle which would make light of its weight and would remount it in no time. Hornblower gave up his horse to be led to the water’s edge and to be coaxed into a boat, while he walked away along the summit of the cliff to take his stand on a high point from which he could overlook both the beach and the head of the gully where Laird would make his final stand.',\n",
       " '” Ten minutes later events suddenly moved with a rush. Brown must have met the marines in their final movement of retreat, for the scarlet uniforms came pouring back up the path, to take up their position along the summit of the cliff, their line reaching nearly to where Hornblower was standing. The French were hard on their heels; Hornblower could see their uniforms moving through the scrub, and the musketry popped furiously along the line. He pushed his captain violently in the ribs, jostling him off the flat rock on which he was standing. Hornblower heard two or three bullets pass over his head as he struggled to keep his footing, and at the same moment a group of French infantry, fifty or more, came bursting out of the bush, running hard for them. They were between Hornblower and the nearest marines; the only way of escape was down the steep face of the cliff, and he had no more than a second in which to make up his mind to take it.',\n",
       " '“Down here!” Longley dropped like a monkey to a narrow ledge below, beckoning him down with waving arms. Two blue–coated infantrymen were close upon him, their bayonets levelled; one of them was shouting something which Hornblower could not understand. He turned and jumped after Longley, his feet just reaching the ledge a dozen feet below; and he swayed there with a vertical drop of over a hundred feet below him. Longley caught his arm, and, leaning outwards, scanned the descent keenly and yet with a nightmare coolness. You see that bush? If we can reach that, we ought to get over there. A musket banged over his head and he felt the wind of the bullet—the French were leaning over the top of the cliff firing down at them. Longley braced himself, and then leaped wildly along the face of the cliff, slid down it in a cloud of dust and fragments, and caught the stout bush he had pointed out to Hornblower.',\n",
       " 'Then, moving cautiously away from it, he found an inequality on which to rest, and from there beckoned again to his captain. Hornblower tried to nerve himself for the leap, and then drew back. Another bullet—it actually struck the ledge close to his feet. Hornblower plunged heavily from the end of the ledge, turning his face to the cliff. Then he crashed into the bush and grasped it madly, his feet seeking foothold. No! Not that foot! T’other one!” Longley’s voice went up into a squeak like a bat’s in the excitement as he edged himself along the cliff and at the same time instructed his captain where to put his hands and feet. Hornblower clung to the cliff face like a fly on a windowpane. His hands and arms were aching already—the activities of two days and a night had already drained his strength. A bullet whacked into the rock between him and the midshipman, a chip which it displaced struck his knee a sharp tap. He looked down, and his head swam at the sight of the drop below him.',\n",
       " 'In his exhausted state he felt he would gladly loose his hold and drop down to the quick death awaiting him. Changing foothold and handhold inch by inch, he shuffled along in accordance with Longley’s instructions. “Are you all right, sir? Wait here while I go and have a look. He kept his face against the cliff, stupid with fatigue and fear. ” They had to get past a projecting boss in the face of the cliff; there was one awful second when Hornblower had no foothold, and with his legs dangling had to stretch to a new handhold. You can rest a bit, if you’d like to,” said Longley solicitously. Hornblower lay on his face in the shallow depression which grooved the cliff, conscious for a space of nothing save the cessation of strain. Then with a rush he remembered everything—his dignity, the work on the beach, the fighting on the summit. He sat up and looked down; with a solid lump of the cliff under him his head would stand that.',\n",
       " 'The beach was clear of guns now, in the darkening evening, and only a few animals stood waiting their turn to be coaxed into the boats. Up above the firing seemed to have died down for a space; either the French had begun to despair of achieving anything further or they were gathering for a last effort. The rest of the descent was easy; they could slide and scramble all the way until he felt the welcome sand under his feet. A worried–looking Brown materialised here, his face clearing as he caught sight of his captain. Cavendish was standing supervising the despatch of the last cutter. ” It was nearly dark now, and the sky gave only a faint light when the marines began to pour down the gully and over the sand. The last shots in the long retreat were fired by the four–pounders mounted in the bows of the two longboats which lay nosing the sand while the final section of marines splashed out into the water to them.',\n",
       " 'The long red tongues of flame lit up the dark masses of Frenchmen swarming down onto the beach, and the blast of grape which they had hurled was followed by a gratifying chorus of screams and cries from the stricken masses. “A very handsome operation indeed,” said Major Laird from his seat in the stern of the longboat beside Hornblower. Hornblower dropping in weariness was inclined to agree with him, although he was shivering with the chill of his soaked breeches, and his hands smarted from cuts and abrasions, and other parts of him pained him with saddle soreness as if they were being held before a fierce fire. They rowed out over the silent sea to a ship strange with the whinnying of horses and smelling stable–like already. Hornblower staggered on board; he saw the boatswain’s mate who held the lantern for him glance curiously at his ragged clothes and white face.',\n",
       " 'He walked blindly past the dark line of horses and mules, picketed head and heel to the deck ringbolts, to the security of his cabin. He ought to make his report to the admiral—surely he could leave that until daylight. The deck seemed to be heaving under him rhythmically. Polwheal was there, and food was laid on the candle–lighted table, but Hornblower later could never remember eating any. Faintly he could remember Polwheal helping him into bed, and a vivid, clear–cut memory always abode with him of hearing Polwheal, through the closed cabin door, arguing with the sentry outside. “’Twarn’t Horny’s fault,” said Polwheal, didactically. Then sleep swooped down upon Hornblower, sleep which held him fast, even though he was conscious through it of the aches and pains which assailed him, of the perils he had encountered that day, of the fear which had tortured him on the cliff.',\n",
       " 'Chapter XIX THE Sutherland was wallowing through the stormy waters of the Gulf of the Lion, under a grey sky, with white–flecked wave tops all round her, while her captain stood on his heaving quarterdeck enjoying the cold blast of the mistral round his ears. The nightmare adventure on the Spanish mainland was three weeks past now; for over a fortnight the ship had been clear of horses and mules, the stable smell had nearly disappeared, and the decks were white once more. Much more important, the Sutherland had been sent away on detached duty with orders to examine the French coast line all the way along to Toulon; he was free from the clogging authority of the admiral again, and he breathed the keen air with the delight of someone released from slavery. Lady Barbara’s husband was not a man whom it was a pleasure to serve.',\n",
       " 'The whole ship seemed to be infected with this feeling of freedom—unless it was pleasure in the contrast between the present weather and the tranquil skies and calm seas which had prevailed so long. Here came Bush, rubbing his hands and grinning like a gargoyle. “Blowing a little, sir,” said Bush, “and it’ll blow harder than this before it’s over. He grinned back, lightheartedly, with a bubbling of high spirits within him. It was quite fantastic how stimulating it was to be thrashing to windward again against a stiff breeze, especially with the nearest admiral a hundred miles away. In southern France that same wind would be causing grumbling and complaints, and the French would be going about hugging their cloaks to them, but here at sea it was perfectly delightful. Bush,” said Hornblower magnanimously, as discretion returned to him and he evaded the tempting snares of falling into idle conversation.',\n",
       " '” Young Longley came aft with the sandglass to attend to the hourly heaving of the log, and Hornblower watched him from the corner of his eye. The boy was carrying himself with assurance now, and gave his orders easily. He was the only one of all the midshipmen whose calculations of the day’s work made any pretence at accuracy, and the incident on the cliff had shown him to be a lad of quick decision. Towards the end of this commission, and at a suitable opportunity, Hornblower decided, he would appoint him acting lieutenant; he watched him bending over the traverse board marking up the hour’s run with a queer wonder as to whether he was observing a future Nelson, an admiral who would some day rule forty ships of the line. He was an ugly little fellow, with his stubbly hair and monkey face, yet it was hard not to feel a surge of affection for him.',\n",
       " 'If little Horatio, the child whom smallpox had killed on the third day in those Southsea lodgings, had grown up in this fashion Hornblower would have been proud of him. Perhaps he might have done—but it was not a good thing to think himself into gloom on a fresh morning like this about the little boy he had loved. There would be another child by the time he reached home. Hornblower hoped it might be a boy; and he was nearly sure that Maria hoped the same. Not that any little boy could quite take the place of Horatio—Hornblower felt a new flood of depression when he remembered how Horatio had said, “Papa! Want papa!” and had rested his face against his shoulder that evening when the first malaise of the illness was creeping over him. He shook his depression off; if his return to England was at the earliest moment he could hope for the child would be crawling about the floor with all a baby’s misdirected zeal.',\n",
       " 'He might even be talking a little, and would hang his head with shyness when his strange papa arrived, so that Hornblower would have the task of winning his confidence and affection. Maria was going to ask Lady Barbara to be godmother to the child—it would be delightful if Lady Barbara agreed. Any child with the influence of the Wellesley family behind it could contemplate a secure future. Without a doubt it was the Wellesley influence which had put Leighton in command of the squadron he was mismanaging. And by this time Hornblower was sure that it was the Wellesley influence which had put him in command of one of the ships of that squadron and retained him in employment without a single day of half–pay. He was still in doubt about what had been Lady Barbara’s motive, but on a stimulating morning like this he could almost venture to believe that it was because she loved him; he would far rather it were that than it should merely be because she admired his professional ability.',\n",
       " 'Or it might be just an amused and tolerant kindliness towards an inferior whom she knew to love her. No matter that he had been afraid to take her—he slurred that memory over in his present indignation—she had offered, and he had declined. As a suppliant once, she had no right to pose to herself now as his patroness. He stamped his feet with mortification as he paced the deck. But his clairvoyance was instantly blurred by his idealism. His memory of a cool and self–collected Lady Barbara, the perfect hostess, the dignified wife of an admiral, was overlaid by mental pictures of a tender Lady Barbara, a loving Lady Barbara, with a beauty which would take a man’s breath away. His heart was torn with longing for her; he felt sick and sad and lonely in his rush of desire for her, for the angel of goodness and sweetness and kindliness he thought her to be.',\n",
       " 'His pulse beat faster as he remembered her white bosom with the sapphire pendant resting on it, and animal desire came to reinforce the boyish affection he bore her. “Sail ho!” bellowed the masthead lookout, and Hornblower’s dreaminess was stripped from him in a flash, like the straw wrapping from a bottle. “Where away?” “Right in the wind’s eye, sir, an’ comin’ up fast. ” A brisk nor’easterly wind like the present meant ideal weather conditions for French ships which wished to escape from the blockade of Marseilles and Toulon. It was a fair wind for the escaping ship, enabling her to get out of harbour and cover a long distance during the first night, while at the same time it pushed the blockading squadron away to leeward. This might well be a ship engaged on breaking the blockade, and if such were the case she would have small chance to escape with the Sutherland right to leeward of her.',\n",
       " 'It would be consistent with the good fortune he had enjoyed on detached service during the present commission if this were to be another prize for him. “Keep her steady as she goes,” said Hornblower, in reply to Bush’s look of inquiry. There were fifty possible explanations of a British frigate’s presence here and on her present course which offered no chance of action as opposed to one which might involve the proximity of an enemy. Her topsails were in sight already, white against the grey sky. “Begging your pardon, sir,” said the gunlayer of one of the port–side quarterdeck carronades. ” Stebbings was one of the hands taken from the East India convoy, a middle–aged man with grey hairs in his beard. ” “Captain Frederick Cooke, sir,” added Vincent, flipping hastily over the pages of the printed list. Cooke had been posted six months later than he had; in the event of any combined operations he would be the senior officer.',\n",
       " '“Yes, she’s the Cassandra, sir,” said Vincent, his eye to his telescope, as a hoist of flags went up to the frigate’s fore–topsail yard–arm. “She’s letting fly her sheets,” said Bush, with a hint of excitement in his voice. ” From time immemorial, dating back long before a practical flag–signalling system had been devised, letting fly the sheets had been a conventional warning all the world over of the approach of a fleet. “It’s hard to read with the flags blowing straight towards us. “Four—hostile—ships of the line—astern—to windward—course—sou’west,” translated Longley with the signal book. ” It was not the Sutherland’s task to fight odds of four to one. If there were any British ships in pursuit he could throw himself in the enemy’s path and rely on crippling at least two Frenchmen so as to ensure their capture, but until he knew more about the situation he must keep as clear as was possible.',\n",
       " '“Ask, ‘Are any British ships at hand?’” he said to Vincent, while the Sutherland first lay over on her side and then rose to an even keel as Bush brought her before the wind. “Reply negative, sir,” said Vincent, a minute later, through the din of clearing for action. The four French ships of the line had broken out of Toulon during the darkness and while the blockading squadron had been blown away to leeward. Only the Cassandra, the inshore lookout, had caught sight of them, and had run before them so as to keep them under observation. It was an interesting exercise, calling for familiarity with the signal book, to frame a message so as to use the fewest number of flags. “Six—miles—astern—bearing—nor’east,” Longley translated from the code book as Vincent read out the numbers.',\n",
       " 'That might merely be because they wanted to put as great a distance as possible between them and the blockading squadron off Toulon, but it was not likely that the officer in command would run wastefully direct to leeward unless that was the course most suited to his plan. It ruled out completely any thought of Sicily or the Adriatic or the Eastern Mediterranean as objective, and it pointed directly to the Spanish coast near Barcelona and beyond that to the Straits of Gibraltar. Hornblower on his quarterdeck set himself to try to think the thoughts of Bonaparte at the Tuileries. Beyond the Straits lay the Atlantic and the whole world. Yet it was hard to imagine any useful objective for four French ships of the line out there; the French West Indies had been nearly all reduced by English expeditions, the Cape of Good Hope was in English hands, Mauritius was about to fall.',\n",
       " 'The French squadron might be intended for a mere commerce–destroying raid, but in that case an equal number of frigates would be both cheaper and more effective. And on the other hand exactly enough time had elapsed for the appearance of Leighton’s squadron on the Catalan coast and the resultant dearth of supplies to have been reported to the Tuileries, and for orders to have been transmitted thence to Toulon. Three British ships on the Catalan coast? Then send four French ones against them. Man them with crews picked from all the ships rotting in Toulon harbour. Load them with all the stores for which the Barcelona garrison is clamouring. Let them slip out one dark night, hack their way through to Barcelona, crush the British squadron if they can, and return if they are lucky. In a week they might be back safe and sound, and if not—every omelette demands the breaking of eggs. That must be the French plan, and he would glady bet all he had that he was right.',\n",
       " 'It only remained to decide how to defeat the French aims, and the opening moves were obvious. First, he must keep between the French and their objective, and second, it would be desirable to keep out of sight of the French, over their horizon, as long as possible—it would be a surprise to them to find a ship of considerable force, and not a mere frigate, in their path; and surprise was half a battle. In that case his first instinctive move had been correct, and the Sutherland was on the right course to achieve both these ends—Hornblower wondered uneasily whether his unthinking mind had jumped at once to the conclusions which his thinking mind had only just reached. All that remained to be done was to call down the Pluto and the Caligula. Three British ships of the line, and a frigate could fight four French ships, picked crews or not, and Bonaparte’s opinion notwithstanding. “Cleared for action, sir,” said Bush, touching his hat. His eyes were bright with the anticipation of action.',\n",
       " 'Hornblower saw in him a fighting man of the type to which he regretted he did not belong—a man who relished the prospect of a battle for its own sake, who loved physical danger, who would never stop to count the odds against him. “Dismiss the watch below, if you please,” said Hornblower. There was no object in keeping every man at his station when action was far distant, and Hornblower saw Bush’s expression alter when he heard the words. They meant that the Sutherland was not going to plunge immediately into action against odds of four to one. There was something to be said for Bush’s point of view, for the Sutherland well handled might knock away so many French spars as to leave two or three at least of the French so crippled as to fall a certain prey into British hands sooner or later. It would be at the cost of her own destruction, however, and he could think about it again later.',\n",
       " 'A fair wind today might still mean a foul wind tomorrow; there might still be time for the Pluto and the Caligula to come up if only they could be informed of the proximity of their prey. “Give me that signal book,” said Hornblower to Longley. He turned its pages, refreshing his memory regarding the wording of some of the arbitrary signals. In sending a long message there was always danger of misunderstanding. And he pulled at his chin while he composed his message. Like every British officer retreating, he was running the risk of having his motives misunderstood, even though, as he told himself petulantly, not even the mad British public, gorged with past victories, could condemn him for refusing action against odds of four to one. But if everything went wrong the Wellesley faction might seek a scapegoat; and the order he was about to transmit might mean the difference between success and failure, between a court of inquiry and the thanks of Parliament.',\n",
       " 'The Cassandra was to set all sail she could carry, and to make use of her frigate’s turn of speed to turn westward, seek out the Pluto and Caligula—Hornblower could not be exact in his description of their position—and bring them down to Barcelona. Phrase by phrase the Cassandra acknowledged the signal. Then there was a pause after its completion, before Vincent, glass to eye, reported. ‘Submit——’” It was the first time Hornblower had ever had that word addressed to him. He had used it so often in signals to admirals and senior captains, had included it so often in reports, and now another officer was beginning a signal to him with the word “Submit. ” It was a clear, definite proof of his growing seniority, and gave him a thrill keener even than he had known when a ship had first piped the side for him on his being posted. Yet naturally that word “submit” ushered in a protest.',\n",
       " 'Cooke of the Cassandra was not in the least anxious to be thus summarily dismissed from the scene of a promising action. He submitted that it would be better for the Cassandra to stay in sight of the French. “Signal ‘Carry out orders acknowledged,’” said Hornblower, tersely. Cooke was wrong and he was right—Cooke’s protest helped his decision to crystallise. A frigate’s whole function, what she was built for, was to enable the ships of the line to come into action. The Cassandra could not face a single broadside from one of the ships rolling along after her; if she could bring the Pluto and the Caligula into action she would have multiplied her own value an infinity of times. It was heart–warming to Hornblower to be not only convinced that he was right, but to be able to enforce the course of action he had decided upon.',\n",
       " 'That six months’ difference in seniority made Cooke obedient to him, and would make him obedient all their lives—if ever Cooke and he flew their flags together as admirals he would still be the senior and Cooke the junior. He watched the Cassandra shake out the reefs from her topsails and bear away westwards, with all her five knots’ superiority of speed being put to its best use now. The French would see the Cassandra vanish over their horizon; there was a chance that the Sutherland might keep them under observation without being seen. He stuck his telescope into his pocket and set himself to climb the mizzen rigging, sedately—even a little laboriously; it was imperilling his dignity to do so, when every hand in the ship could climb the mast quicker than he, but he had to see with his own eyes the enemy astern of him. The ship was plunging heavily in the following sea, and the wind blew keenly about his ears.',\n",
       " 'It called for resolution to continue his ascent without undignified pauses, so as to appear merely as leisurely as a captain had a right to be, and yet neither timid nor awkward. At last he found a secure perch on the mizzen topmast crosstrees, and could train his glass on the heaving horizon. With her main topsail taken in the Sutherland’s speed was considerably reduced, and it could not be long before the French appeared. He saw them soon enough—a tiny rectangle of white just lifting over the horizon, then another beside it, and another, and another. ” The four French ships were rolling along in lubberly French fashion in a wide line abreast, half a mile apart—presumably their captains were afraid of collision if they drew closer—and it was a hundred to one that their lookouts would never notice the tiny dot which would be all they could see of the Sutherland. Savage came tumbling up beside him, hardly out of breath after his lightning scramble up the ratlines.',\n",
       " '“You see the French squadron? I want to hear instantly if they alter course, or if they head–reach upon us, or we on them. He had done all he could do now, when he reached the deck again. It only remained to wait, patiently, until tomorrow. Tomorrow would see some sort of battle, hopeless or even—or if there were no battle it would mean that the French had disappeared and he would go before a courtmartial. He was careful to keep his expression quite composed, and to try to appear as if he did not feel the tension of waiting in the least. It would be in the old tradition if he invited his officers to dinner and whist tonight.',\n",
       " 'Chapter XX THE SITUATION was one likely to disturb any captain’s sleep, with four hostile ships of the line to windward needing to be kept under observation, and with calculations continually bobbing up from the subconscious to the conscious regarding the chances of the Cassandra bringing down Admiral Leighton in time to cut off the enemy. The weather conditions were unsettling, too—the wind, having worked up nearly to gale force towards evening, diminished until midnight, increased again, and then, with the inconsequence of Mediterranean winds, began to die away steadily. When the watch was changed in the evening he lay down on his cot to have a rest, and, being quite convinced that he had no chance of sleeping, he naturally fell into a deep dreamless sleep so heavy that Polwheal had to shake him by the shoulder at midnight to awaken him. He came on deck to find Bush standing by the binnacle.',\n",
       " '“Too dark for anything to be seen, sir,” said Bush, and then, excitement and exasperation getting the better of his formality, he growled, “Black as Newgate Knocker. ” “Have you seen anything of the enemy?” “I thought I did, sir, half an hour back, but nothing to be sure of. As so often was the case at sea, there was nothing to do but wait. Two screened lanterns swayed down on the main deck, where the watch lay at their stations by the guns; the keen wind harped in the rigging, and the ship rose and plunged in the following sea with a lightness and grace no one would expect of her who had only seen her with the wind abeam. Nothing to do but to wait; if he stayed on deck he would only fidget and display his nervousness, so he might as well go and conceal his nervousness in his screened–off cot. “Send for me at once if you catch sight of the enemy,” he said, with elaborate carelessness, and went back again below.',\n",
       " 'He lay on his cot with his mind busy, for he knew that having slept once there was no chance whatever of sleeping again. So perfect was this conviction that sleep ambushed him once more, leaped upon him unawares, as he lay thinking about the Cassandra, so that it only seemed two minutes later that he heard Polwheal speaking to him as if from another world. Gerard’s compliments, sir, an’ it’s beginnin’ to get lighter, sir. ” It called for quite an effort to rouse himself and get up from his cot; only when he was drowsily on his feet did he begin to feel pleased at having been genuinely asleep each time that Polwheal came to call him. He could picture Polwheal telling his cronies about the iron nerves of the captain, who could sleep like a child on a night when the ship was aboil with the prospect of action. I had to reef down for an hour at two bells, it blew so hard. But it’s dropping fast now, sir, and backing sou’easterly.',\n",
       " 'The faintest hint of light was beginning to tinge the gloomy sky, but nothing could be seen yet more than a cable’s length away. A southeasterly wind would be nearly foul for the French on their course to Barcelona; it would be dead foul for the Pluto and Caligula. “Thought I felt the loom o’ the land, sir, before the light came,” said Gerard. Their course during the night would bring them close into Cape Creus of hated memory; he picked up the slate beside the binnacle, and, calculating from the hourly readings of the log, he made their position to be some fifteen miles off the cape. If the French had held the same course during the night they would soon have Rosas Bay and comparative security under their lee—of course, if they had not, if they had evaded him in the darkness, the consequence to him did not bear thinking about. Eastwards the watery clouds seemed to be thinning just above the horizon.',\n",
       " 'Undoubtedly they were thinning; for a second they parted, and a speck of gold could be seen through them, just where the white–flecked sea met the sky, and a long beam of sunlight shone level over the sea. “Land–ho!” yelled the masthead lookout, and westward they could see a bluish smudge on the horizon where the mountains of Spain loomed faintly over the curve of the world. And Gerard glanced anxiously at his captain, took a turn or two up and down the deck, gnawed at his knuckles, and then could restrain his impatience no longer. “Masthead, there! What do you see of the enemy?” The pause that followed seemed ages long before the reply came. ” Gerard renewed his anxious glance at his captain, but Hornblower, during that pause, had set his face sternly so that his expression was unmoved. Bush was coming onto the quarterdeck now; anyone could see that he was wild with anxiety.',\n",
       " 'If four French ships of the line had evaded action it would mean half–pay for Hornblower for life, if nothing worse. Hornblower retained his stony expression; he was proud of being able to do so. Gerard, if you please, and lay her on the starboard tack. ” The French might perhaps have altered course in the darkness, and might now be lost in the centre of the Western Mediterranean, but Hornblower still did not think it likely. His officers had made insufficient allowance for the lubberliness of the unpracticed French. If Gerard had had to reef topsails in the night they might well have had to heave–to; and both Bush and Gerard were overeager—during the night the Sutherland might have gained twenty miles on the French. By retracing his course he was confident that he would sight them again. Confident as far as the whist–playing part of his mind was concerned, that is to say.',\n",
       " 'He could not control the sick despair in his breast, nor the acceleration of his heart beats; he could only conceal them, keeping his face a mask and forcing himself to stand still instead of pacing about in his anxiety. Then he thought of an activity which would help to occupy his mind and yet not betray his nervousness. His hands were just steady enough to permit him to shave, and a chill bath under the wash–deck pump gave him new vigour. He put on clean clothes and parted his lessening hair with elaborate exactitude, for under the wash–deck pump he had told himself that they would sight the French again before he had completed his toilet. It was with a sense of acute disappointment that he laid down the comb when he had no more smallest excuse to continue its use, and turned to put on his coat, with no news of the French. And then, with his foot on the companion, there came a wild yell from Midshipman Parker at the masthead.',\n",
       " 'Four! It’s the enemy!” Hornblower continued his progress up the companion without faltering in his step, and he hoped people noticed it. Bush was halfway up the rigging with his glass, and Gerard was pacing—almost prancing—about the quarterdeck in his delight. Observing them, Hornblower was glad he had had no childish doubts about the correctness of his actions. ” A talkative captain might supplement the order with a brief explanation of the necessity for keeping the ship between the French and Spain, but Hornblower bit off the explanation as it rose to his lips. “The wind’s still working round southerly, sir,” said Gerard. And it would drop, a good deal, too, as the day progressed, he decided. The sun was fast breaking through the clouds, with every prospect of a warm day—a Mediterranean autumn day, with a rising barometer and only the faintest of breezes.',\n",
       " 'The hammocks had been piled in the netting, and the watch not at their stations were clattering onto the deck with buckets and holystones. The routine of the Navy had to be maintained, even though there was every chance that the decks they were swabbing would be running with blood before the day was over. The men were skylarking and joking—Hornblower felt a little thrill of pride as he looked at them and remembered the sullen despondent crowd with which he had sailed. Consciousness of real achievement was some compensation for the thankless service which employed him; and it helped him to forget, too, the uneasy feeling that today or tomorrow—soon, anyway—he would know again, as the whirl of battle eddied round him, the physical fear of which he was so intolerably ashamed.',\n",
       " 'As the sun climbed up the sky the wind dropped steadily, moving round even more southerly, and the mountains of Spain came nearer and nearer and grew more and more defined as their course brought them closer to the land. Hornblower held on as long as he could, bracing up his yards as the wind veered, and then finally heaving–to while the French squadron crept up over the horizon. The shift in the wind had deprived them of the windward position; if they moved down to attack him he could escape northward so that if they pursued him they would be running towards the Pluto and Caligula, but he had no hope that they would. French ships of the line who had evaded the blockading squadron would race to accomplish their mission first, and would only fight afterwards, however tempting the bait dangled before them. If the wind shifted no farther round they could just hold their course for Barcelona, and he had not the least doubt that they would do so if not prevented.',\n",
       " 'He would hang on to them and try to attack some isolated ship during the night if no help arrived. “They’re signalling a lot, sir,” said Bush, his glass to his eye. They had been signalling all day, for that matter—the first flurry of bunting, Hornblower shrewdly surmised, had been occasioned by their catching sight of the Sutherland, unaware that she had been keeping company with them for fifteen hours. Frenchmen retained their talkative habits at sea, and no French captain was happy without messages passing back and forth along the squadron. The Sutherland was clear of the Cape Creus peninsula now, and Rosas Bay was opening out on her beam.',\n",
       " 'It was in these very waters, but in very different weather conditions, that the Pluto had lost her masts and had been towed to safety by the Sutherland; over there, on those green–grey slopes, had occurred the fiasco of the attack on Rosas; through his glass Hornblower thought he could discern the precipitous face of the mesa up which Colonel Claros had led his fugitive Catalans. If the wind came farther round now, the French had a refuge open to them under the guns of Rosas, where they would be safe until the British could bring up fireships and explosion vessels to drive them out again; actually it would be a more secure refuge for them than the anchorage at Barcelona. He looked up at the pendant flapping at the masthead—the wind was certainly southerly.',\n",
       " 'It was growing doubtful whether the French would weather Palamos Point on their present tack, while he would certainly have to go about soon and stand out into the Frenchmen’s wake, with all his advantage of position lost by the inconstancy of the weather. And the wind was beginning to come in irregular puffs now—a sure sign of its diminishing force. He turned his glass on the French squadron again to see how they were behaving. There was a fresh series of signals fluttering at their yard–arms. Savage?” “I think—I’m not quite sure, sir—there’s another sail, right on the horizon, sir, abaft the enemy’s beam. Otherwise it would only be Leighton’s ships or the Cassandra. Hornblower swung himself up into the shrouds and climbed upwards. At Savage’s side he trained his glass in the direction indicated. For a second the French squadron danced in the object glass, disregarded, as he searched.',\n",
       " '” It was the tiniest fleck of white, too permanent for a wave crest, of a different shade from the few clouds against the blue. Hornblower nearly spoke, but succeeded in limiting himself to “Ha—h’m. ” “It’s nearer now, sir,” said Savage, telescope to eye. Some ship under full sail was out there beyond the Frenchmen, and standing in to cross their wake. He said no more, but snapped his telescope shut and addressed himself to the descent. Bush dropped to the deck to meet him from the shrouds he had ascended; Gerard, Crystal, they were all on the quarterdeck eyeing him anxiously. “The Cassandra,” said Hornblower, “standing in towards us. ” By saying that, he was risking his dignity to demonstrate his good sight. No one could guess the new arrival to be the Cassandra from just that glimpse of her royals. But it could only be the Cassandra who would be on that course, unless his judgment were sadly at fault.',\n",
