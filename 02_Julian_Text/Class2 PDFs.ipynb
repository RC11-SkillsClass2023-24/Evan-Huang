What is it, if the   old concepts of architecture now lie with machines, which, in  their application of these concepts, are quick, adaptable,  competent, aesthetic, optimised and sustainable? We are at  once bored and worried, and we watch as machinic creativity  extends its entropic reach.

Both are, in equal measure,  machinistic articulations of information. Whether we  critically want to do something for the climate, against   hunger or for the rainforest, or enforce politically  correct rules for language; whether we pragmatically  develop new medicines, install security and surveil- lance systems, set up logistics for world trade, or  fundamentally attempt the fusion of atoms; inspired,  fascinated or terrified by the exponentially growing  speed and the power of the machines, we harmonise  and homogenise everything we can lay our hands   on in an ever escalating pro-and-con.

The Generic. out of sheer impatience, we  now only have room for good and evil, as measured,  for example, by co2 emissions. energy efficiency,  sustainability, climate change, world famine… – these  are the battle cries of a machinic generic world.  tyranny (particles) and terror (waves) balance each  other in the entropic heat death of the universe. Quantum, negentropy, information: all these don’t. They are  not part of this game. Because information is, just like quanta,   neither matter nor energy. They are the vertical stabilities in   a horizontal machinistic stream. A new, more abstract mathe- matics, a new, more abstract language, a new, more abstract  technology now come before any specificity of machines.  human beings who understand this language, who master  this technology, are able to talk to each other – unimpressed  by the constant stream of necessities – about possibilities.  talk politically, on solid, economic ground, have a say and  enter compacts about the future of our world.

       "  'We are born into a new world today. A world in which  no longer people, but things embody what Vitruvian  Man has learnt since the renaissance. But in this  exactly we are like him: because he, too, was born into  a new world. Which is why he can set an example   for us: he shaped and instrumentalised the movement   of his world with the ratio in time, by putting spatial  elements into mutual perspectives – allowing them to  talk to each other, so to speak. later, as the outraged  icon of revolution, Marianne formalised and orches- trated the movement of her world in the rationality of  time. And so, in the language of space, the search   was on for a common, fictitious, temporal origin of any   element whatsoever (enlightenment).  All of this today is embodied by things. They are temporal  elements, and no longer the spatial elements of Vitruvian  Man or of the revolutionary Marianne. today, we are born  into this new world of temporal elements. And just like  leonardo, and before him Vitruvius, we shape and instrument- alise our world. Just not with spatial elements and the ratio   of a time, but now with temporal elements and the ratio of   a ‘life’, as we might cautiously suggest. one which we, like  Vitruvius and leonardo, put into a mutual perspective and  effectively let talk to each other (today we no longer call this  ‘perspective’ but ‘communication’, and we mirror ourselves  not on the horizon but in coincidence.) ',\n",
       "  'so there’s a lot we can learn from the masters of   all times.

All of  this is increasingly dull, because it repeats, over and over again.  ',\n",
       "  'here, we get a quiet, intelligent, de-escalated, marvel- ling, stimulated, stirred up, but not complaining, not  engaged, not critical, not analytical, not classifying,  but decidedly personal compilation. We are taken   on an odyssey about media in architecture. It follows   the traces, the bearings of abstract heroes – all of   this in an attempt at giving a shape to the digital world,   and in the knowledge that it may easily take another  100, perhaps 300 years before a project of this kind is  concluded and we can begin to logically capture the  new perspectivity of our world.

       "  'They say it would take 1100 years by plane to fly around VY  canis Majoris, one of the largest known stars in the universe,  with a diameter of 1,976,640,000 kilometres. luckily my planet  is about 155,000 times smaller, and my species has success-  fully built a generic communication network on it that’s now  shared across the globe. still, I am no longer sure that the   size of the sphere really matters. While earth’s 20th century  infrastructure was based on a “finite amount of ice in our   ice caps,”1 what we call the digital infrastructure seems to  work outside any physical constraints. If that is the case,   then what kinds of limits do I have? Perhaps this is the wrong  question to ask. how about: what shall I do and where shall  we fly off together with our digital infrastructure?  As a designer and theorist, my intention with this  book is to avoid direct theorisation of the phenomena  and, instead, to be experimental. My subjective  analyses and speculations are dedicated to character- ising the relationship between digital infrastructure  and media architecture. For me, media architecture is  digital infrastructure based architecture, which is  something more than blinking leD displays, mood  walls and responsive installations. The glamorous  appearance of media facades instantly attracts people,  ',\n",
       "  'for sure. But they mediate not only colourful relations  but also technologically encrypted ones. And my  interest is far from approaching them technically:   I would like to talk about abstract ‘prisms’ that could  radially shed a light on the phenomena in a broader  technological context. so what I try to do is under- stand the vividness and fantasticality of media  architecture based on infrastructural cultivation and  articulation. Accordingly, the terms ‘digital infra- structure’ and ‘media architecture’ will appear and  disappear, contract and expand, evaporate and  crystallise throughout this book.  As the result of an experiment, this work has taken the form  of four distinct Atlases. I did not plan to have four of them  from the beginning. The seed was a mini-atlas of digital infra-  structures that I made towards the end of 2011. In 2012,   I was mostly busy fighting the giant cockroaches of singapore,   but I still managed to sort through my greatest fantasies   in the digital world, clustering and re-clustering hundreds of  images of digital life and media architecture. From 2013  onwards, each Atlas was born, one after the other, in parallel  with my doctoral research in Zürich. But this book is not a  doctoral thesis; it shares its spirit, but it tells intimate stories  that could not have been told in an academic format.           ',\n",
       "  'each Atlas in turn has its own set of categories. These  categories are sometimes literary, sometimes rational;  sometimes pragmatic, sometimes only fuzzy; but as  with everything: the more we look at them, and   talk about them, the better we will get to know them.   I hope this book will be a fantastical forest whose  creatures may carry an abundance of unknown and  exhilarating names.  '],\n",

The interesting  thing is that all of this is described as a trade, rather than as  magic, trickery, or metamorphosis. And perhaps there is   a reason for this: magic would need a recipe, metamorphosis  would carry a motif. But what about a trade? That sounds  rather more serious and formal, because ‘trade’ is an economic   term that evokes a value exchange or transaction, and possibly   the acquisition of a particular skill. to the very end of the  story, it remains obscure what the ‘trade that no-one knows’  really is. Perhaps it isn’t the ‘business’ of the transformations  at all, but the commitment to, and process of, wooing? or  belief in yourself and in any assistance the world may have   to offer you? Perhaps it does not matter. readers accept   the story as it is because through it, Paul wins the ‘love of the  princess’, and so we allow the intensity of the storytelling to  take over.  ',\n",
       "  'Delving into the idea of an abstract trade may help us  understand how digital infrastructure works. half   a century ago, the meaning of the word ‘infrastructure’   was confined to material. concrete bridges, criss- crossing railroads, mass transit, public housing,   dams, highways and airports. We accessed them quite  literally, since a train was a train was a train. By  contrast, with the bits of digital infrastructure, trades  occur not only between things, but also between dif-  ferent dimensions, systems, people, and abstractions:  image to sound, gesture to function, 2D to 3D,  algorithm to capital, event to signal. It’s in formation  steady and quick. It is no longer static (unless we   are talking about server farms and ethernet cables  exclusively). Digital infrastructure is a flexible   mixture of various technologies that seem to engage   in a dance with each other: sensing, wireless network- ing, GPs, information processing and pattern   recognition, web services, mobile computing… In  each context, it performs a different pattern, forms   a new network. And inside the network there can   be anything: a hag, a hawk, a garland, flowers, millet  seed, chickens, flagstones, a fox, a self or whatever  else there is in the world, or indeed what isn’t, but what   we can, or think we can, imagine! But of course digital infrastructure never works randomly.  code strictly pre-defines meta operations, relations and  processes, while being able to embrace and index   various kinds of data. Because of this openness I inhabit  different instances of trade each time: it gives me the   experience of digital infrastructure as something obscure   and airy.  '],\n",

       "  'When, not long ago, I found myself in need of a public phone  booth in Zürich – which I realise would never happen to a  ‘smart’ citizen – I was enchanted by it twice. First of all, I had  to find one. This was not difficult: there is usually a pink,  purple, or occasionally yellow neon glow over the booth head  that is visible from afar and that seems to beckon you hither.  Then, I had to enter it. since the booth has the shape of a  transparent cylinder, the glass door is curved. I slid the door  along its curvature, stepped inside and closed the door around  me. even before I was isolated from the sounds of the street,   I could hear a mellow, melancholy melody spread around me,  as if some mist was being sprayed on me from above. It was  unexpected, but romantic. Yet as soon as I picked up the  receiver, the music gently faded out and was forgotten in a  matter of seconds. having finished my call, I slid the door open  and the sound spray returned: the phone booth was saying  goodbye to me. how lovely! Thinking about it the next day,   I realised it wasn’t really saying goodbye to me, it simply plays  music whenever the door is open. And I also knew that   this is something that can be easily understood. All of that   ',\n",
       "  'so the answer to the initial question, ‘What is digital  infrastructure and where is it?’ surely lies right here:  no one knows exactly, because it’s constantly   changing. nevertheless, it does have its own stability.  '],\n",
       " 12: ['ATLAS I — Affair with Phantoms 24 25 ',\n",
       "  'notwithstanding, and regardless of the semi-automation trick  that I can understand and that I know had ‘fooled’ me, I fell in  love with the manner in which this booth had treated me.  A fake baby seal can do even better. Paro, a robot that  comes in the shape of a white harp seal, routinely  befriends Japanese elderly people without difficulty.2  The insanely cute – as is the concept – behaviour of  Paro does not need an interaction model. It responds  to sound, it makes sounds of its own, it knows its  name, and its coat is made of antibacterial fur that is  meant to be touched. everybody knows that Paro   is not alive. It’s artificial. A real seal would never hold  a plastic nipple in its mouth (this is the charger,   by the way), blink its jet-black eyes like a human baby,  or wag its tail like a puppy. But this $ 6,000 device   is designed for pure intimacy. surrogate it may be, but  nevertheless: it is a kind of intimacy. ',\n",
       "  'now: what if I were to tap into media architecture at the same  level of intimacy, with the same kind of pleasure, the same  vivid experience? What if I were to do so and at the same time  ask myself, ‘Who do I want to meet: an insanely cute robot  seal, a mellow musical phone booth, or perhaps a mixture of  both? What would a mixture of both be like? or maybe I want  to meet something else entirely? or all of them? What   would I do with them? What kind of conversation do I want  to have with them?’ A space like Ada: The Intelligent Room (2002; page  254 –255) behaves not all that differently from how  Paro works. Despite its comparative technological  sophistication and complexity, Ada instantly invites  us into its universe while playing an intimate game.

It has nothing to do with technological  invention, but is in fact an ‘affair-ical’ invention all of its own  character. science fiction writer Bernard Werber offers his  account of horse whispering, while speculating about an  unusual type of relationship between horses and us.4 horses  in general, but especially smart ones, are known to be curious  about the external world, and when this natural curiosity   is constrained, they may suffer mental instability as a result:  blinkers – the eye covers that restrict their field of vision   to make them less susceptible to being spooked or frightened –   actually drive them crazy. According to Werber, by whisper- ing in a horse’s ear, the horse whisperer can build a special  relationship with the animal that goes beyond that of the  exploiter and the exploited. By and by the horse accepts this  approach and way of communicating, responds to it positively   and begins to effectively ‘overlook’ the fact that a human  being curtails its natural aspiration to discover the world on  its own.

       "  'Bruce sterling, a science fiction author and design critic, calls  people who ‘hassle with spimes’ ‘wranglers’. Introduced in   the non-fiction book Shaping Things (2005), the term ‘spime’ –   a contraction of the words ‘space’ and ‘time’ – describes   an abstract, speculative object in our techno-society that is   a “material instantiation of an immaterial system;”7 therefore   it is not an object in the strict sense and always, but only  when it ‘has to be’. Thus, spimes go beyond artefacts, machines,   products and gizmos.8 rFIDs are the most familiar example  of spimes. A spime can be ‘instantiated’ only through me   and so it is tied to my identity and has its unique ID code that   is named and tracked through space and time. What do   I wrangle then? I negotiate the nature of my stake holding, my  desire, my interest, through the dynamicity and connectedness   of spimes. As spimes interact with the immaterial world  through my own identity, I have a chance to extend my limits  beyond merely that which I can hunt, buy and consume; this  is the core activity of wranglers.

In his Spheres trilogy, Dasein is an intrinsically   spatial affair: “Being-in-the-world is being-in-spheres.”9  Inside the sphere, there is not just one being, there are others  as well, so we coexist. It’s social, but also climatic and atmos- pheric. We are very much used to this sensation.  It is not too difficult to reflect sloterdijk’s sphereology  in the digital world. The digital world similarly has  symbolic spheres, narrative bubbles, climatic encryp- tions, geodesic domes of data, co-constituted and  co-connected foams. Does that mean, then, that all  these efforts and organisations equally are headed  towards possession of their own authentic and ecstatic  sense of being?   '],\n",

The  stories she tells are so fascinating, and with each one  she gets just to the middle before she pauses and  invokes the break of dawn as her reason for not   continuing, until the following night. The pleasure of  hearing how the story ends is suspended, and before  anything untoward might cross the King’s mind, the new  pleasure of a new story is on offer, but only if she lives.  What Scheherazade does for one thousand and one  nights10 is to stretch each night, to survive in the face   of a rule and a set pattern that demands her death;   it is to overcome authority and to break the boundaries  set for her by this authority. But it’s not that easy:   Scheherazade has to fine-tune a plot here and there,  adjust her tone, reading the King’s countenance and his  reaction each night, lest she should anger or bore him  and he cry ‘enough!’ And so in this kind of story,   invented, embodied each night afresh, there is no real  climax, there is only a continuation of curious and  entertaining events that may go on for as long as time  itself, just as long as the listener wants to hear more.  And thus Scheherazade, the irresistible story teller,  softens, heals and wins over the King’s heart. '],\n",

The story of Orlando – the novel by Virginia Woolf –   early on features a brief, intense and vividly evoked love  affair between our hero, then still a man, and Natasha,   a Russian Princess.13 His subsequent metamorphosis  into a woman, however, although unexpected, presents  no real sensation. Instead, it comes as a fact we just  have to accept, as does the now Lady Orlando, who  gets to keep her personality, her intellect, her essential  character traits, and, after some legal wranglings, also  her property. Having once, as a young man, been a lover  to the ageing Queen Elizabeth I, Orlando now goes   on to live a further three hundred years, avoiding a suitor  who knew her when she was a man and who was then  herself a woman but who now is a man, eventually  marries and finally, in 1928, publishes her poem: the one  constant in her life. What never changes is the fact that  Orlando engenders the sources of the The Oak Tree,  enriched by the gendered events of her life. '],\n",

Whereas  physical and material comfort are priorities within  the infrastructure of auto-functionality, these spaces  perhaps give preference to imaginational and poetic  comfort. It may be difficult to reason thus within   a classical functional frame, but I hold on to the fact  that there is a certain kind of functioning that goes  with a certain kind of consistency. They are not  advocates of abnormality, but they position them- selves quite close to it. Many projects that I am going  to introduce in this Atlas are ‘para-normal’ in the  sense that they don’t meet conventional functionality  and expectations. In an interview about a recent  '],\n",
       " 57: ['114 115 ATLAS II — Para-desire ',\n",
       "  'public Ar (Augmented reality) project, the designer,  whose name escapes me, was asked “what reality is  augmented?” – “users themselves,” he replied. It is in  fact possible that only subjective realities are ever  produced and therefore normalities exist side by side.  I call this type of organisation an infrastructure of  para-functionality. I can’t resist mentioning designers and educators Anthony  Dunne and Fiona raby here, as they have been key ‘wranglers’  in this kind of infrastructure. In their books Design Noir: The  Secret Life of Electronic Objects (2001) and Hertzian Tales:  Electronic Products, Aesthetic Experience, and Critical Design  (2005), Dunne and raby depict two different rationalities   that are present in the design of electronic products and  environments.2 They highlight contrasts between usefulness  and provocativeness, optimisation and aesthetic experiment,  transparency and curiosity, practical needs and poetry.  Through these tags, designers are invited to be critical about  the ‘sterilised’ mindset that is seen to lie behind electronic  product design.  ',\n",
       "  'one of Dunne and raby’s design strategies includes  functional estrangement, followed by the idea of  para-functionality. This is defined as: “a form of design   where function is used to encourage reflection on  how electronic products condition our behaviour. The  prefix ‘para-’ suggests that such design inhabits the  realms of utility but attempts to go beyond conventional   definitions of functionalism to include the poetic.”3  Dunne’s notion of para-functionality does not match  exactly with how I view it, in the sense that functionality   is deliberately used as a means of provocation. The  result is at times bold and purely nonsensical. In this  ',\n",
       "  'case functionality can also be seen as deterministic.  But some of the para-functional artefacts and   spaces that he gives as examples are very close to   my interest. Denis santachiara’s Portale (1989),   for instance, simply sparks when somebody passes  through, leaving plenty of room for the user to relate  to it;4 Krzysztof Wodiczko’s Personal Instrument  (1969) consists of a microphone worn on the forehead  that picks up ambient noise, photo-receivers that are  fitted into a pair of gloves and are used to manipulate  the sound, and a set of personal headphones so   only the wearer can hear the output;5 Diller + scofidio’s   Para-Site (1989) uses electronic objects like tVs   and video cameras that are integrated into new hybrid  objects and playfully take over their exhibition   space.6 Para-functionality, then, does not mean anti-  functionality or malfunction, but a condition that  brings us into other spaces where we are the sensitive  subjects that inhabit it.  ',\n",
       "  'none of this is to say that there are clean cut divisions between   auto-functionality and para-functionality: but there is room  for thought on the spectrum that lies in-between the two  poles, and there is room for thought on how technology   is involved. Whether amplified or concealed by information  technology, both the way a space is meant to function and  how an infrastructure ‘carries’ people may fall into various  categories: comfort vs. pleasure, intelligence vs. vitality,   sense vs. sensibility, security vs. adventure, communication   vs. conversation, efficiency vs. ambiguity, prose vs. poetry,  didactic vs. seductive, universal vs. specific, essential vs.  inessential. '],\n",
       " 58: ['116 117 ATLAS II — Para-desire ',\n",
       "  'Para-desire    ',\n",
       "  'let’s turn our attention then to the un-neutrality of the user  when inhabiting the infrastructure of para-functionality,  since all these things are conditional on our own perception  and abstraction. Where does such a functionality come from?  how does it exist in the real world? Would it be helpful   to observe the reality from an inverse perspective, that is to  say, from within ourselves? ‘Desire’, ‘sensitivity’, ‘imagination’,  ‘fantasy’. These words don’t weigh so much when I flatten  myself to the role of ‘standard user’ from the beginning. But  the infrastructure of para-functionality lives on because   our psychological needs largely contribute to it; if they didn’t,  it would become fairly pointless.  ',\n",
       "  'so, looking at the other side of the coin, I set para-  desire as an analytic frame by which the phenomena  of media architecture can be intimately re-blended.   I use the prefix ‘para-’ to mean ‘alongside’ or ‘resem- bling’, rather than ‘abnormal’ or ‘incorrect’ in the  pathological sense. ‘Para-’ zooms in on the inessential  nature – viewed from a perspective of classic   architectural necessities – that the infrastructure   of para-functionality cultivates.  ',\n",
       "  'likewise, instead of looking at desire merely from an elemental   dimension, such as in terms of our physiological and sexual  ',\n",
       "  'needs, I want to focus on our contingent, marginal, ambiguous   and also creative thirsts.  And I ask, where do our surreal desires live, and what  are their strategies?  Infra-natural, infra-ordinary, and infra-speculative are the  three para-sites and strategies of para-desire. In infra-natural,  the para-sites are natural elements, environments and  metaphors. In infra-ordinary, the main para-sites are everyday   objects and contexts. In infra-speculative, the para-site is   the immanent self.  Why does desire need ‘para-sites’? Because desire  cannot exist on its own, especially as a single object,   a thing, or a site. For example, I cannot desire a bag   in itself, because there are always external connections   to my own specific psychological, social, political,  economic factors why I would want that bag and no  other. What it all amounts to may be vanity, formality,  practicality, pure fun, anything whatsoever. That  means desire is rarely a discrete thing but the set of  interconnected conditions that are most likely  invisible at first glance. some philosophers call this   an aggregate7 of relations. And any kind of desire could   be potentially approached as an aggregate, whether   it is ordinary or unordinary.     '],\n",

       "  'For this Atlas, I would like to take you on a meandering   trip into a variety of gardens to collect some gifts offered by   the artificial space. no doubt, the word ‘gift’ has multiple   meanings. even at its most obvious, it can signify two very  different things: a present given to somebody, or a talent  bestowed by nature. Interestingly, educator Friedrich Froebel  (1782 –1852) developed some special educational toys, which  he called ‘Gifts’ and which embrace both definitions: the   toys were given to children as play-gifts, but for adults they  served as tools to observe the innate human gifts of the child  at the same time.1 Gift 1, for example, is a set of ‘yarn balls’  through which the child forms his or her first impressions of  the physical world by holding, rolling and matching the  colourful balls; Gift 2 is a set consisting of sphere, cylinder  and cube, with a wooden box where these can be hung to  compare their differences; Gift 3 is a divided cube, Gift 4 a set  of rectangular prisms.2 My point is that if we put our minds   ',\n",
       "  'in a state of both adult and child, we may be able to discover   a number of gifts in the fantastical space of gardens. We   will run around in the  great ancestors’ field, synchronise and  expand with the universes of gardens.  ',\n",
       "  'no garden in the world is natural. I have every reason  to believe that gardens relax us on the one hand   and stimulate us on the other, and that they do both  through their plants and natural life, but in actual  fact, a garden is as artificial as a theme park. Ancient  egyptian gardens tried to encapsulate nature by  capturing condensed atmospheres from various  places. egyptians planted tamarisk, acacia, and fig  trees for their fruit and for shade. French formal  gardens – Baroque gardens – are radical insofar as  their geometrical compositions push hard against our  notion of what a garden as ‘nature’ may look like:   they do not really resemble nature at all, but make a  point of imposing on nature their order. Then, a little  later, english landscape gardens return to sceneries  that emulate nature, even though almost every single   tree is carefully positioned. Japanese Zen gardens   use plants sparsely, sometimes not at all. All of which  suggests that these greener parts of the world have  never simply aspired to being just green; rather, they  have been implanting their own individual imagination   of an ideal into reality.   Instead of gardens, I could have chosen other milieus, such as  pavilions, libraries, skyscrapers, castles, zoos, cathedrals. But  the critical attraction that entices me to proceed into gardens  is their few functional and contextual limits. especially their  relative vastness that is nevertheless enclosed gives me the  privilege to speculate freely about what can be thought, and  '],\n",

       "  'how this can be represented. looking at the spectrum of  aesthetic strategies, expressions and fantasies, as well as at  the political, metaphysical ambitions of gardens in the   world, it transpires that a garden is almost whatever it can be.  I myself can become a king, a monk, a working class family  man, an artist, a tourist, a foreigner, an architect, a dwarf or   a giant while visiting different gardens.    And so for our field trip together, I pose the following  abstract questions: ‘how can an idea enter physical  reality?’, ‘What are the possible choices, transforma- tions, topologies between ideal and reality?’, ‘Does an  ideal change in the process of becoming ideal?’ In  Baroque gardens, the ambition of the garden designer  is often presented in a didactical and highly intellectual   manner, whilst in landscape gardens what you see   is nearly what you believe. Monastic gardens have the  least decorative reality, whereas everything in Zen  gardens is coached in symbolic weight, and folly  gardens orchestrate bold thresholds of things. What   I hope is that these questions will connect us back   to the world of digital infrastructure and media  architecture, where processes, morphologies, treat- ments and glues between the conceptual and the  perceptual, the cognitive and the representational, the  immaterial and the material are fully activated.

       "  'Because of the multiplex dimensions we’re about to enter,   I want to carry out an experiment through fourfold analysis.  This may appear a little bizarre or esoteric at first glance,  particularly because of its cross-shaped schema. But it’s  simply a way of thinking that has been in existence for a long  time, and we find it everywhere we care to look: in philosophy,   in architecture, in art, in astrology, in psychoanalysis, in  politics, in literature. A fine example of ancient fourfold  thinking lies in empedocles’ four elements: water, fire, air and  earth. each element is intriguingly linked to every other,  while they all have a cyclical nature. Another example: earth,  divinities, sky, mortals.3 earth cannot stand alone without   a sky, mortals cannot attain their meaning without the gods;  earth relates to the mortals’ mortality, whereas divinities find  their truth in the heavens that we imagine in the sky.4 There   is a sense of completeness, a whole that is greater than   the sum of its parts, rather than of a mere structure with four  individual components. The Garden is also in principle  double-folded, dividing the inside from the outside, separating   the earth from the sky; the divine from the earthly, fountain  '],\n",

       "  'looking at things through such a lens of manifoldness  and fullness, fourfold analysis may help us extract   the innate gifts of the gardens. I have previously  mentioned Froebel’s Gifts as a metaphor for what   I hope to discover and how, but to my utter delight,   it turns out he was also a deeply fourfold thinker:  “From objects to pictures, from pictures to symbols,  from symbols to ideas, leads the ladder of knowledge”. Thus, once we have collected the Gifts of the Gardens, we   will climb back to the digital world by means of such a fantas-  tical ‘ladder’. In fact, it will be closer to ‘flying’ than ‘climbing’:  flying on a ‘spaceship’ of four gifts, which will enlarge the  horizon of our fantastical space. ',\n",

       "  'While we are constantly surprised, excited, overwhelmed  even, by the drama of the Baroque garden, the English  garden allows us to relax, to find peace, stroll about. The  smooth, round-edged landscape of the English garden  does not say ‘look at me, now!’ Instead it invites us to  feel free and forget about our worries and our strife. It  was only after the industrial revolution of the 18th century  that the English garden appeared as an entity. With   the emergence of new classes in the new society, people  sought a new mentality, which went against absolutism:  emancipation through a utopian vision of nature. Never- theless, the English garden does not imitate nature in   the way Egyptian or Chinese gardens do. Nor does it try  to represent nature with meaning. Instead, it celebrates  its own idyllic rationality with gently rolling hills, ponds,  and an apparently arbitrary arrangement of all different  kinds of trees. ',\n",

It’s not the type of garden whose  look and feel evolves through the generations, as the   use of plants and water forms only a marginal dimension.   A Zen garden is spiritual in a different way to the English  garden. Whereas in the English garden your soul unwinds  as you stroll through the grounds, in the Zen garden   you are asked to make an effort to find the right vantage  point, the right mental state and the right resolution.   Still, a common virtue in the Zen garden’s rationality is to  imitate nature and to borrow from it. A constellation   of miniaturised nature and the universe are the protocols  of the Zen journey.

Many kinds of cabbage, leek, onion, carrot,  white beet, rosemary, rose, primrose, hyssop, violet, basil,   monkshood, parsley, grape, pomegranate were cultivated,   mostly for self-sufficiency. As the tissue of the monastic  garden was used for food, one might call it a ‘kitchen  garden’ too; but there is a thin line between farming and  gardening. Monastic gardens were not merely there   for producing food (which would be farming), but they  were also a place for state-of-the-art horticulture research   and development.        ',\n",

The term ‘folly’ might indicate faux  Roman or Greek temples or towers, but it is also used   in the English and Baroque garden to mean a structure  that serves no discernible purpose (and is therefore aught   but a ‘folly’). But when follies populate the garden to   the extent that it is fully occupied with their eccentricities,  they are no longer just a constituent element of the  garden, but the whole thing becomes a crazy Folly garden.   The rock garden of Chandigarh or Bruno Weber Park in  the outskirts of Zürich came about that way. They pretty  much resemble ‘art brut’, because each is made by a  single individual in his spare time, tinkering away at it for  years. These gardens tend not to look friendly so much  as fascinating, and they are loaded with unfamiliar, highly  enigmatic references.   ',\n",

It’s not complicated.   Our question was: what is the nature  of relations between elements for  there to be desire, for these elements   to become desirable? I don’t desire   a woman — I am ashamed to say that  since Proust already said it, and it’s  beautiful in Proust. I don’t desire   a woman, I also desire a landscape  that is enveloped in this woman,   a landscape that, if needs be, I don’t  know — but that I can feel. As long   as I haven’t yet unfolded the land-  scape that envelops her, I will not be  happy, that is, my desire … will  remain unsatisfied… I don’t desire   an aggregate either, I desire within   an aggregate… Drinking never meant  solely ‘I desire to drink’ and that’s it.  It means, either, I desire to drink all  alone while working, or drink all alone  while relaxing, or going out to find  friends to have a drink, go to some  little cafe… To desire is to construct  an assemblage.” 8  http://noamtoran.com/NT2009/ projects/accessories-for-lonely-men  (retrieved January 2016) 9  Jacque Carelmain, Catalogue  d’objets introuvables (Le Cherche  Midi, 2003).
