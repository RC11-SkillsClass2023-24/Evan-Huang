       " 'The Daughter of Huang ChowI: \"Diamond Fred\" In the saloon bar of a public–house, situated only a few hundred yards from the official frontier of Chinatown, two men sat at a small table in a corner, engaged in earnest conversation.',\n",
       " ' They afforded a sharp contrast. One was a thick–set and rather ruffianly looking fellow, not too cleanly in either person or clothing, and, amongst other evidences that at one time he had known the prize ring, possessing a badly broken nose.',\n",
       " ' His companion was dressed with that spruceness which belongs to the successful East End Jew; he was cleanly shaven, of slight build, and alert in manner and address. Having ordered and paid for two whiskies and sodas, the Jew, raising his glass, nodded to his companion and took a drink.',\n",
       " ' The glitter of a magnificent diamond which he wore seemed to attract the other\\'s attention almost hypnotically. \"Cheerio, Freddy!\" said the thick–set man. \"Any news?\" \"Nothing much,\" returned the one addressed as Freddy, setting his glass upon the table and selecting a cigarette from a packet which he carried in his pocket.',\n",
       " ' \"I\\'m not so sure,\" growled the other, watching him suspiciously. \"You\\'ve been lying low for a long time, and it\\'s not like you to slack off except when there\\'s something big in sight.\" \"Hm!\" said his companion, lighting his cigarette.',\n",
       " ' \"What do you mean exactly?\" Jim Poland—for such was the big man\\'s name—growled and spat reflectively into a spittoon. \"I\\'ve had my eye on you, Freddy,\" he replied; \"I\\'ve had my eye on you!\" \"Oh, have you?\" murmured the other.',\n",
       " ' \"But tell me what you mean!\" Beneath his suave manner lay a threat, and, indeed, Freddy Cohen, known to his associates as \"Diamond Fred,\" was in many ways a formidable personality. He had brought to his chosen profession of crook a first–rate American training, together with all that mental agility and cleverness which belong to his race, and was at once an object of envy and admiration amongst the fraternity which keeps Scotland Yard busy.',\n",
       " ' Jim Poland, physically a more dangerous character, was not in the same class with him; but he was not without brains of a sort, and Cohen, although smiling agreeably, waited with some anxiety for his reply.',\n",
       " ' \"I mean,\" growled Poland, \"that you\\'re not wasting your time with Lala Huang for nothing.\" \"Perhaps not,\" returned Cohen lightly. \"She\\'s a pretty girl; but what business is it of yours?\" \"None at all.',\n",
       " ' I ain\\'t interested in \\'er good looks; neither are you.\" Cohen shrugged and raised his glass again. \"Come on,\" growled Poland, leaning across the table. \"I know, and I\\'m in on it. D\\'ye hear me? I\\'m in on it.',\n",
       " ' These are hard times, and we\\'ve got to stick together.\" \"Oh,\" said Cohen, \"that\\'s the game, is it?\" \"That\\'s the game right enough. You won\\'t go wrong if you bring me in, even at fifty–fifty, because maybe I know things about old Huang that you don\\'t know.',\n",
       " '\" The Jew\\'s expression changed subtly, and beneath his drooping lids he glanced aside at the speaker. Then: \"It\\'s no promise,\" he said, \"but what do you know?\" Poland bent farther over the table. \"Chinatown\\'s being watched again.',\n",
       " ' I heard this morning that Red Kerry was down here.\" Cohen laughed. \"Red Kerry!\" he echoed. \"Red Kerry means nothing in my young life, Jim.\" \"Don\\'t \\'e?\" returned Jim, snarling viciously. \"The way he cleaned up that dope crowd awhile back seemed to show he was no jug, didn\\'t it?\" The Jew made a facial gesture as if to dismiss the subject.',\n",
       " ' \"All right,\" continued Poland. \"Think that way if you like. But the patrols have been doubled. I suppose you know that? And it\\'s a cert there are special men on duty, ever since the death of that Chink.',\n",
       " '\" Cohen shifted uneasily, glancing about him in a furtive fashion. \"See what I mean?\" continued the other. \"Chinatown ain\\'t healthy just now.\" He finished his whisky at a draught, and, standing up, lurched heavily across to the counter.',\n",
       " ' He returned with two more glasses. Then, reseating himself and bending forward again: \"There\\'s one thing I reckon you don\\'t know,\" he whispered in Cohen\\'s ear. \"I saw that Chink talking to Lala Huang only a week before the time he was hauled out of Limehouse Reach.',\n",
       " ' I\\'m wondering, Diamond, if, with all your cleverness, you may not go the same way.\" \"Don\\'t try to pull the creep stuff on me, Jim,\" said Cohen uneasily. \"What are you driving at, anyway?\" \"Well,\" replied Poland, sipping his whisky reflectively, \"how did that Chink get into the river?\" \"How the devil do I know?\" \"And what killed him? It wasn\\'t drowning, although he was all swelled up.',\n",
       " '\" \"See here, old pal,\" said Cohen. \"I know \\'Frisco better than you know Limehouse. Let me tell you that this little old Chinatown of yours is pie to me. You\\'re trying to get me figuring on Chinese death traps, secret poisons, and all that junk.',\n",
       " \" Boy, you're wasting your poetry. Even if you did see the Chink with Lala, and I doubt it—Oh, don't get excited, I'm speaking plain—there's no connection that I can see between the death of said Chink and old Huang Chow.\",\n",
       " '\" \"Ain\\'t there?\" growled Poland huskily. He grasped the other\\'s wrist as in a vise and bent forward so that his battered face was close to the pale countenance of the Jew. \"I\\'ve been covering old Huang for months and months.',\n",
       " ' Now I\\'m going to tell you something. Since the death of that Chink Red Kerry\\'s been covering him, too.\" \"See here!\" Cohen withdrew his arm from the other\\'s grasp angrily. \"You can\\'t freeze me out of this claim with bogey stuff.',\n",
       " \" You're listed, my lad, and you know it. Chief Inspector Kerry is your pet nightmare. But if he walked in here right now I could ask him to have a drink. I wouldn't but I could. You've got the wrong angle, Jim.\",\n",
       " ' Lala likes me fine, and although she doesn\\'t say much, what she does say is straight. I\\'ll ask her to–night about the Chink.\" \"Then you\\'ll be a damned fool.\" \"What\\'s that?\" \"I say you\\'ll be a damned fool.',\n",
       " \" I'm warning you, Freddy. There are Chinks and Chinks. All the boys know old Huang Chow has got a regular gold mine buried somewhere under the floor. But all the boys don't know what I know, and it seems that you don't either.\",\n",
       " '\" \"What is that?\" Jim Poland bent forward more urgently, again seizing Cohen\\'s wrist, and: \"Huang Chow is a mighty big bug amongst the Chinese,\" he whispered, glancing cautiously about him. \"He\\'s hellish clever and rotten with money.',\n",
       " ' A man like that wants handling. I\\'m not telling you what I know. But call it fifty–fifty and maybe you\\'ll come out alive.\" The brow of Diamond Fred displayed beads of perspiration, and with a blue silk handkerchief which he carried in his breast pocket he delicately dried his forehead.',\n",
       " ' \"You\\'re an old hand at this stuff, Jim,\" he muttered. \"It amounts to this, I suppose; that if I don\\'t agree you\\'ll queer my game?\" Jim Poland\\'s brow lowered and he clenched his fists formidably. Then: \"Listen,\" he said in his hoarse voice.',\n",
       " ' \"It ain\\'t your claim any more than mine. You\\'ve covered it different, that\\'s all. Yours was always the petticoat lay. Mine\\'s slower but safer. Is anyone else in with you?\" \"No.\" \"Then we\\'ll double up.',\n",
       " ' Now I\\'ll tell you something. I was backing out.\" \"What? You were going to quit?\" \"I was.\" \"Why?\" \"Because the thing\\'s too dead easy, and a thing like that always looks like hell to me.\" Freddy Cohen finished his glass of whisky.',\n",
       " ' \"Wait while I get some more drinks,\" he said. In this way, then, at about the hour of ten on a stuffy autumn night, in the crowded bar of that Wapping public–house, these two made a compact; and of its outcome and of the next appearance of Cohen, the Jewish–American cracksman, within the ken of man, I shall now proceed to tell.',\n",
       " 'II: The End of Cohen \"I\\'ve been expecting this,\" said Chief Inspector Kerry. He tilted his bowler hat farther forward over his brow and contemplated the ghastly exhibit which lay upon the slab of the mortuary.',\n",
       " ' Two other police officers—one in uniform—were present, and they treated the celebrated Chief Inspector with the deference which he had not only earned but had always demanded from his subordinates. Earmarked for important promotion, he was an interesting figure as he stood there in the gloomy, ill–lighted place, his pose that of an athlete about to perform a long jump, or perhaps, as it might have appeared to some, that of a dancing–master about to demonstrate a new step.',\n",
       " ' His close–cropped hair was brilliantly red, and so was his short, wiry, aggressive moustache. He was ruddy of complexion, and he looked out unblinkingly upon the world with a pair of steel–blue eyes. Neat he was to spruceness, and while of no more than medium height he had the shoulders of an acrobat.',\n",
       " ' The detective who stood beside him, by name John Durham, had one trait in common with his celebrated superior. This was a quick keenness, a sort of alert vitality, which showed in his eyes, and indeed in every line of his thin, clean–shaven face.',\n",
       " ' Kerry had picked him out as the most promising junior in his department. \"Give me the particulars,\" said the Chief Inspector. \"It isn\\'t robbery. He\\'s wearing a diamond ring worth two hundred pounds.\" His diction was rapid and terse—so rapid as to create the impression that he bit off the ends of the longer words.',\n",
       " ' He turned his fierce blue eyes upon the uniformed officer who stood at the end of the slab. \"They are very few, Chief Inspector,\" was the reply. \"He was hauled out by the river police shortly after midnight, at the lower end of Limehouse Reach.',\n",
       " ' He was alive then—they heard his cry—but he died while they were hauling him into the boat.\" \"Any statement?\" rapped Kerry. \"He was past it, Chief Inspector. According to the report of the officer in charge, he mumbled something which sounded like: \\'It has bitten me,\\' just before he became unconscious.',\n",
       " '\" \"\\'It has bitten me,\\'\" murmured Kerry. \"The divisional surgeon has seen him?\" \"Yes, Chief Inspector. And in his opinion the man did not die from drowning, but from some form of virulent poisoning.\" \"Poisoning?\" \"That\\'s the idea.',\n",
       " ' There will be a further examination, of course. Either a hypodermic injection or a bite.\" \"A bite?\" said Kerry. \"The bite of what?\" \"That I cannot say, Chief Inspector. A venomous reptile, I suppose.\" Kerry stared down critically at the swollen face of the victim, and then glanced sharply aside at Durham.',\n",
       " ' \"Accounts for his appearance, I suppose,\" he murmured. \"Yes,\" said Durham quietly. \"He hadn\\'t been in the water long enough to look like that.\" He turned to the local officer. \"Is there any theory as to the point at which he went in?\" \"Well, an arrest has been made.',\n",
       " '\" \"By whom? of whom?\" rapped Kerry. \"Two constables patrolling the Chinatown area arrested a man for suspicious loitering. He turned out to be a well–known criminal—Jim Poland, with a whole list of convictions against him.',\n",
       " ' They\\'re holding him at Limehouse Station, and the theory is that he was operating with―—\" He nodded in the direction of the body. \"Then who\\'s the smart with the swollen face?\" inquired Kerry. \"He\\'s a new one on me.',\n",
       " '\" \"Yes, but he\\'s been identified by one of the K Division men. He is an American crook with a clean slate, so far as this side is concerned. Cohen is his name. And the idea seems to be that he went in at some point between where he was found by the river police and the point at which Jim Poland was arrested.',\n",
       " '\" Kerry snapped his teeth together audibly, and: \"I\\'m open to learn,\" he said, \"that the house of Huang Chow is within that area.\" \"It is.\" \"I thought so. He died the same way the Chinaman died awhile ago,\" snapped Kerry savagely.',\n",
       " ' \"It looks very queer.\" He glanced aside at the local officer. \"Cover him up,\" he ordered, and, turning, he walked briskly out of the mortuary, followed by Detective Durham. Although dawn was not far off, this was the darkest hour of the night, so that even the sounds of dockland were muted and the riverside slept as deeply as the great port of London ever sleeps.',\n",
       " \" Vague murmurings there were and distant clankings, with the hum of machinery which is never still. Few of London's millions were awake at that hour, yet Scotland Yard was awake in the person of the fierce–eyed Chief Inspector and his subordinate.\",\n",
       " ' Perhaps those who lightly criticize the Metropolitan Force might have learned a new respect for the tireless vigilance which keeps London clean and wholesome, had they witnessed this scene on the borders of Limehouse, as Kerry, stepping into a waiting taxi–cab accompanied by Durham, proceeded to Limehouse Police Station in that still hour when the City slept.',\n",
       " ' The arrival of Kerry created something of a stir amongst the officials on duty. His reputation in these days was at least as great as that of the most garrulous Labour member. The prisoner was in cells, but the Chief Inspector elected to interview him in the office; and accordingly, while the officer in charge sat at an extremely tidy writing–table, tapping the blotting–pad with a pencil, and Detective John Durham stood beside him, Kerry paced up and down the little room, deep in reflection, until the door opened and the prisoner was brought in.',\n",
       " ' One swift glance the Chief Inspector gave at the battle–scarred face, and recognized instantly that this was a badly frightened man. Crossing to the table he took up a typewritten slip which lay there, and: \"Your name is James Poland?\" he said.',\n",
       " ' \"Four convictions; one, robbery with violence.\" Jim Poland nodded sullenly. \"You were arrested at the corner of Pekin Street about midnight. What were you doing there?\" \"Taking a walk.\" \"I\\'ll say it again,\" rapped Kerry, fixing his fierce eyes upon the man\\'s face.',\n",
       " ' \"What were you doing there?\" \"I\\'ve told you.\" \"And I tell you you\\'re a liar. Where did you leave the man Cohen?\" Poland blinked his small eyes, cleared his throat, and looked down at the floor uneasily.',\n",
       " ' Then: \"Who\\'s Cohen?\" he grunted. \"You mean, who was Cohen?\" cried Kerry. The shot went home. The man clenched his fists and looked about the room from face to face. \"You don\\'t tell me―—\" he began huskily.',\n",
       " ' \"I\\'ve told you,\" said Kerry. \"He\\'s on the slab. Spit out the truth; it\\'ll be good for your health.\" The man hesitated, then looked up, his eyes half closed and a cunning expression upon his face. \"Make out your own case,\" he said.',\n",
       " ' \"You\\'ve got nothing against me.\" Kerry snapped his teeth together viciously. \"I\\'ve told you what happened to your pal,\" he warned. \"If you\\'re a wise man you\\'ll come in on our side, before the same thing happens to you.',\n",
       " '\" \"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about,\" growled Poland. Kerry nodded to the constable at the doorway. \"Take him back,\" he ordered. Jim Poland being returned to his cell, Kerry, as the door closed behind the prisoner and his guard, stared across at Durham where he stood beside the table.',\n",
       " ' \"An old hand,\" he said. \"But there\\'s another way.\" He glanced at the officer in charge. \"Hold him till the morning. He\\'ll prove useful.\" From his waistcoat pocket he took out a slip of chewing gum, unwrapped it, and placed the mint–flavoured wafer between his large white teeth.',\n",
       " ' He bit upon it savagely, settled his hat upon his head, and, turning, walked toward the door. In the doorway he paused. \"Come with me, Durham,\" he said. \"I am leaving the conduct of the case entirely in your hands from now onward.',\n",
       " '\" Detective Durham looked surprised and not a little anxious. \"I am doing so for two reasons,\" continued the Chief Inspector. \"These two reasons I shall now explain.\".',\n",
       " 'III: The Secret Treasure-house Unlike its sister colony in New York, there are no show places in Limehouse. The visitor sees nothing but mean streets and dark doorways. The superficial inquirer comes away convinced that the romance of the Asiatic district has no existence outside the imaginations of writers of fiction.',\n",
       " ' Yet here lies a secret quarter, as secret and as strange, in its smaller way, as its parent in China which is called the Purple Forbidden City. On a morning when mist lay over the Thames reaches, softening the harshness of the dock buildings and lending an air of mystery to the vessels stealing out upon the tide, a man walked briskly along Limehouse Causeway, looking about him inquiringly, as one unfamiliar with the neighbourhood.',\n",
       " ' Presently he seemed to recognize a turning to the right, and he pursued this for a time, now walking more slowly. A European woman, holding a half–caste baby in her arms, stood in an open doorway, watching him uninterestedly.',\n",
       " ' Otherwise, except for one neatly dressed young Chinaman, who passed him about halfway along the street, there was nothing which could have told the visitor that he had crossed the borderline dividing West from East and was now in an Oriental town.',\n",
       " ' A very narrow alleyway between two dingy houses proved to be the spot for which he was looking; and, having stared about him for a while, he entered this alleyway. At the farther end it was crossed T–fashion, by another alley, the only object of interest being an iron post at the crossing, and the scenery being made up entirely of hideous brick walls.',\n",
       " ' About halfway along on the left, set in one of these walls, were strong wooden gates, apparently those of a warehouse. Beside them was a door approached by two very dirty steps. There was a bell–push near the door, but upon neither of these entrances was there any plate to indicate the name of the proprietor of the establishment.',\n",
       " ' From his pocket–book the visitor extracted a card, consulted something written upon it, and then pressed the bell. It was very quiet in this dingy little court. No sound of the busy thoroughfares penetrated here; and although the passage forming the top of the \"T\" practically marked the river bank, only dimly could one discern the sounds which belong to a seaport.',\n",
       " ' Presently the door was opened by a Chinese boy who wore the ordinary native working dress, and who regarded the man upon the step with oblique, tired–looking eyes. \"Mr. Huang Chow?\" asked the caller. The boy nodded.',\n",
       " ' \"You wantchee him see?\" \"If he is at home.\" The boy glanced at the card, which the visitor still held between finger and thumb, and extended his hand silently. The card was surrendered. It was that of an antique dealer of Dover Street, Piccadilly, and written upon the back was the following: \"Mr.',\n",
       " ' Hampden would like to do business with you.\" The signature of the dealer followed. The boy turned and passed along a dim and perfectly unfurnished passage which the opening of the door had revealed, while Mr.',\n",
       " ' Hampden stood upon the step and lighted a cigarette. In less than a minute the boy returned and beckoned to him to come in. As he did so, and the door was closed, he almost stumbled, so dark was the passage.',\n",
       " ' Presently, guided by the boy, he found himself in a very business–like little office, where a girl sat at an American desk, looking up at him inquiringly. She was of a dark and arresting type. Without being pretty in the European sense, there was something appealing in her fine, dark eyes, and she possessed the inviting smile which is the heritage of Eastern women.',\n",
       " ' Her dress was not unlike that of any other business girl, except that the neck of her blouse was cut very low, a fashion affected by many Eurasians, and she wore a gaily coloured sash, and large and very costly pearl ear–rings.',\n",
       " ' As Mr. Hampden paused in the doorway: \"Good morning,\" said the girl, glancing down at the card which lay upon the desk before her. \"You come from Mr. Isaacs, eh?\" She looked at him with a caressing glance from beneath half–lowered lashes, but missed no detail of his appearance.',\n",
       " ' She did not quite like his moustache, and thought that he would have looked better cleanshaven. Nevertheless, he was a well–set–up fellow, and her manner evidenced approval. \"Yes,\" he replied, smiling genially.',\n",
       " ' \"I have a small commission to execute, and I am told that you can help me.\" The girl paused for a moment, and then: \"Yes, very likely,\" she said, speaking good English but with an odd intonation. \"It is not jade? We have very little jade.',\n",
       " '\" \"No, no. I wanted an enamelled casket.\" \"What kind?\" \"Cloisonne.\" \"Cloisonne? Yes, we have several.\" She pressed a bell, and, glancing up at the boy who had stood throughout the interview at the visitor\\'s elbow, addressed him rapidly in Chinese.',\n",
       " ' He nodded his head and led the way through a second doorway. Closing this, he opened a third and ushered Mr. Hampden into a room which nearly caused the latter to gasp with astonishment. One who had blundered from Whitechapel into the Khan Khalil, who had been transported upon a magic carpet from a tube station to the Taj Mahal, or dropped suddenly upon Lebanon hills to find himself looking down upon the pearly domes and jewelled gardens of Damascus, could not well have been more surprised.',\n",
       " \" This great treasure–house of old Huang Chow was one of Chinatown's secrets—a secret shared only by those whose commercial interests were identical with the interests of Huang Chow. The place was artificially lighted by lamps which themselves were beautiful objects of art, and which swung from the massive beams of the ceiling.\",\n",

       " ' Last, but not least, sitting cross–legged upon a low couch, was old Huang Chow, smoking a great curved pipe, and peering half blindly across the place through large horn–rimmed spectacles. This couch was set immediately beside a wide ascending staircase, richly carpeted, and on the other side of the staircase, in a corresponding recess, upon a gilded trestle carved to represent the four claws of a dragon, rested perhaps the strangest exhibit of that strange collection—a Chinese coffin of exquisite workmanship.',\n",

Otherwise, you\\'ll be up before the magistrate, and on your record alone it will mean a holiday which you probably don\\'t want.',\n",
       " '\" He was very truculent, but I got him in a good humour at last, and he admitted that he had been cooperating with the dead man, Cohen, in an attempt to burgle the house of Huang Chow. His reluctance to go into details seemed to be due rather to fear of Huang Chow than to fear of the law, and I presently gathered that he regarded Huang as responsible for the death not only of Cohen, but also of the Chinaman who was hauled out of the river about three weeks ago, as you well remember.',\n",
       " ' The post–mortem showed that he had died of some kind of poisoning, and when we saw Cohen in the mortuary, his swollen appearance struck me as being very similar to that of the Chinaman. (See my report dated 31st ultimo.',\n",
       " ') He finally agreed to talk if I would promise that he should not be charged and that his name should never be mentioned to anyone in connection with what he might tell me. I promised him that outside the ordinary official routine I would respect his request, and he told me some very curious things, which no doubt have a bearing on the case.',\n",
       " \" For instance, he had discovered—I don't know in what way—that the dead Chinaman, whose name was Pi Lung, had been in negotiation with Huang Chow for some sort of job in his warehouse. Poland had seen the man talking to Huang's daughter, at the end of the alley which leads to the place.\",\n",
       " ' He seemed to attach extraordinary importance to this fact. At last: \"I\\'ll tell you what it is,\" he said. \"That Chink was a stranger to Limehouse; I can swear to it. He was a gent of his hands; I reckon they\\'ve got \\'em in China as well as here.',\n",
       " ' He went out for the old boy\\'s money–box, and finished like Cohen finished.\" \"Make your meaning clearer,\" I said. \"My meaning\\'s this: Old Huang Chow is the biggest dealer in stolen and smuggled valuables from overseas we\\'ve got in London.',\n",
       " \" He's something else as well; he's a big swell in China. But here's the point. He's got business with buyers all over London, and they have to pay cash—no checks. He doesn't bank it: I've proved that. He's got it in gold, or diamonds, or something, being wise to present conditions, hidden there in the house.\",\n",
       " ' Pi Lung was after his hoard. He didn\\'t get it. Cohen and me was after it. Where\\'s Cohen?\" I agreed that it looked very suspicious, and presently: \"When I went in with Cohen,\" continued Poland, \"I knew one thing he didn\\'t know—a short cut into the warehouse.',\n",
       " \" He's been playing pretty–like with Lala, old Huang's daughter, and it's my belief that he knew where the store was hidden; but he never told me. We knew there were special men on duty, and we'd arranged that I was to give a signal when the patrol had passed.\",\n",
       " \" Cohen all the time had planned to double on me. While I was watching down on the Causeway end he climbed up and got in through the skylight I'd shown him. When I got there he was missing, but the skylight was open.\",\n",
       " ' I started off after him.\" Then Poland clutched me, and his fright was very real. \"I heard a shriek like nothing I ever heard in my life. I saw a light shine through the trap, and then I heard a sort of moaning.',\n",
       " ' Last, I heard a bang, and the light went out. I staggered down the passage half silly, started to run, and ran straight into the arms of two coppers.\" This evidence I thought was conclusive, and in accordance with your instructions I proceeded to Mr.',\n",

I adopted a very simple disguise, just altering my complexion and sticking on a moustache with spirit gum, hair by hair, and trimming it down military fashion.\",\n",
       " \" Everything ran smoothly, and I seemed to make a fairly favourable impression upon Lala Huang, the Chinaman's daughter, who evidently interviews prospective customers before they are admitted to the warehouse.\",\n",
       " \" She is a Eurasian and extremely good looking. But when I found myself in the room where old Huang keeps his treasures, I really thought I was dreaming. It's a collection that must be worth thousands. He showed me snuff–bottles, cut out of gems, and with a little opening no bigger than the hole in a pipe–stem, but with wonderful paintings done inside the bottles.\",\n",
       " \" He'd got a model of a pagoda made out of human teeth, and a big golden rug woven from the hair of Circassian slave girls. Excuse this, Chief Inspector; I know it is what you call the romantic stuff; but I think it would have impressed you if you had seen it.\",\n",
       " \" Anyway, I bought a little enamelled box, in accordance with Mr. Isaacs's instructions, although whether I succeeded in convincing Huang Chow that I knew anything about the matter is more than doubtful.\",\n",

       " ' He explained that he would pack the purchase for me, but that I must personally take it away. And: \"You understand,\" said he, \"that you bought it from a gentleman who had purchased it abroad.\" I said I quite understood.',\n",

       " ' I knew I must make good use of my time, but you have never given me a job I liked less. I mean, there is something very appealing about her, and I hated to think that I was playing a double game.

       " ' \"Yet if it is not to bring happiness, what good is it?\" \"What good indeed?\" murmured Durham. \"There is no fun for me,\" said the girl pathetically. \"Sometimes someone nice comes to do business, but mostly they are Jews, Jews, always Jews, and―—\" Again she shrugged eloquently.',\n",

       " '\" \"Cohen?\" \"A funny little chap,\" continued the girl. \"He tried to make love to me.\" She lowered her lashes roguishly. \"I knew all along he was pretending. He was a thief, I think. I was afraid of him.',\n",
       " '\" Durham did some rapid thinking, then: \"Did you say his name was Cohen?\" he asked. \"That was the name he gave.\" \"A man named Cohen, an American, was found dead in the river quite recently.\" Lala stopped dead and clutched his arm.',\n",
       " ' \"How do you know?\" she demanded. \"There was a paragraph in this morning\\'s paper.\" She hesitated, then: \"Did it describe him?\" she asked. \"No,\" replied Durham, \"I don\\'t think it did in detail. At least, the only part of the description which I remember is that he wore a large and valuable diamond on his left hand.',\n",
       " '\" \"Oh!\" whispered Lala. She released her grip of Durham\\'s arm and went on. \"What?\" he asked. \"Did you think it was someone you knew?\" \"I did know him,\" she replied simply. \"The man who was found drowned.',\n",
       " ' It is the same. I am sure now, because of the diamond ring. What paper did you read it in? I want to read it myself.\" \"I\\'m afraid I can\\'t remember. It was probably the Daily Mail.\" \"Had he been drowned?\" \"I presume so—yes,\" replied Durham guardedly.',\n",
       " ' Lala Huang was silent for some time while they paced on through the dusk. Then: \"How strange!\" she said in a low voice. \"I am sorry I mentioned it,\" declared Durham. \"But how was I to know it was your friend?\" \"He was no friend of mine,\" returned the girl sharply.',\n",
       " ' \"I hated him. But it is strange nevertheless. I am sure he intended to rob my father.\" \"And is that why you think it strange?\" \"Yes,\" she said, but her voice was almost inaudible.

       " ' \"It was nice of you to walk along with me,\" she said. \"Do you live in Limehouse?\" \"No,\" replied Durham, \"I don\\'t. As a matter of fact, I came down here to–night in the hope of seeing you again.\" \"Did you?\" The girl glanced up at him doubtfully, and his distaste for the task set him by his superior increased with the passing of every moment.',\n",

       " ' \"My father\\'s servant. He let you in this morning.\" \"And why must he not see you?\" \"I don\\'t trust him. I think he tells my father things.\" \"What is it that he carries in his hand?\" \"A birdcage, I expect.',\n",
       " '\" \"A birdcage?\" \"Yes!\" He caught the gleam of her eyes as she looked up at him out of the shadow. \"Is he, then, a bird–fancier?\" \"No, no, I can\\'t explain because I don\\'t understand myself.

       " ' Isn\\'t it funny?\" The girl laughed in a childish way. \"And now I think Ah Fu will have gone in, so I must say good night.\" But when presently Detective Durham found himself walking back along West India Dock Road, his mind\\'s eye was set upon the slinking figure of a Chinaman carrying a birdcage.',\n",

Such recreations are allowed, if not encouraged, by all wise rulers of Eastern peoples. \"Found drowned,\" too, is a verdict which has covered many a dark mystery of old Thames, but \"Found in the river, death having been due to the action of some poison unknown,\" is a finding which even in the case of a Chinaman is calculated to stimulate the jaded official mind.',\n",
       " ' New Scotland Yard had given Durham a roving commission, and had been justified in the fact that the second victim, and this time not a Chinaman, had been found under almost identical conditions. The link with the establishment of Huang Chow was incomplete, and Durham fully recognized that it was up to him to make it sound and incontestable.',\n",

Some mystery surrounded the life of the old dealer, who was said to be a mandarin of high rank, but his exact association with the deaths first of the Chinaman Pi Lung, and second of Cohen, remained to be proved.',\n",

Nevertheless, as he entered the area which harbours those strange, hidden resorts the rumour of which has served to create the glamour of Chinatown, he found himself to be thinking of the great influence said to be wielded by Huang Chow, and wondering if unseen spies watched his movements.',\n",
       " ' Lala was Oriental, and now, alone in the night, distrust leapt into being within him. He had been attracted by her and had pitied her. He told himself now that this was because of her dark beauty and the essentially feminine appeal which she made.',\n",

       " ' Old Huang, who had received his caller in the large room upstairs, the room which boasted the presence of the writing–dais, had exhibited no trace of confusion, assuring the sergeant that he had not seen the man Cohen for several days.',\n",

       " ' In short, nothing had been gained by this official interrogation, and Huang blandly denied any knowledge of an attempted burglary of his establishment. \"What have I to lose?\" he had asked the inquirer.',\n",
       " ' \"A lot of old lumber which I have accumulated during many years, and a reputation for being wealthy, due to my lonely habits and to the ignorance of those who live around me.\" Durham, mentally reviewing the words of the report, reconstructed the scene in his mind; and now, having come to the end of the lane where the iron post rested, he stood staring up at a place in the ancient wall where several bricks had decayed, and where it was possible, according to the statement of the man Poland, to climb up on to a piece of sloping roof, and thence gain the skylight through which Cohen had obtained admittance on the night of his death.',\n",
       " ' He made sure that his automatic pistol was in his pocket, questioned the dull sounds of the riverside for a moment, looking about him anxiously, and then, using the leaning post as a stepping–stone, he succeeded in wedging his foot into a crevice in the wall.',\n",
       " ' By the exercise of some agility he scrambled up to the top, and presently found himself lying upon a sloping roof. The skylight remained well out of reach, but his rubber–soled shoes enabled him to creep up the slates until he could grasp the framework with his hands.',\n",
       " ' Presently he found himself perched upon the trap which, if his information could be relied upon, possessed no fastener, or one so faulty that the trap could be raised by means of a brad–awl. He carried one in his pocket, and, screwing it into the framework, he lifted it cautiously, making very little noise.',\n",
       " ' The trap opened, and up to his nostrils there stole a queer, indefinable odour, partly that which belongs to old Oriental furniture and stuffs, but having mingled with it a hint of incense and of something else not so easily named.',\n",
       " ' He recognized the smell of that strange store–room, which, as Mr. Hampden, he had recently visited. For one moment he thought he could detect the distant note of a bell. But, listening, he heard nothing, and was reassured.',\n",
       " ' He rested the trap back against the frame, and shone the ray of an electric torch down into the darkness beneath him. The light fell upon the top of a low carven table, dragon–legged and gilded. Upon it rested the model pagoda constructed of human teeth, and there was something in this discovery which made Durham feel inclined to shudder.',\n",
       " ' However, the impulse was only a passing one. He measured the distance with his eye. The little table stood beside a deep divan, and he saw that with care it would be possible to drop upon this divan without making much noise.',\n",
       " ' He calculated its exact position before replacing the torch in his pocket, and then, resting back against one side of the frame, he clutched the other with his hands. He wriggled gradually down until further purchase became impossible.',\n",
       " ' He then let himself drop, and swung for a moment by his hands before releasing his hold. He fell, as he had calculated, upon the divan. It creaked ominously. Catching his foot in the cushions, he stumbled and lay forward for a moment upon his face, listening intently.',\n",
       " 'VII: The Scuffling Sound Detective Durham, as he lay there inhaling the peculiar perfume of the place, recognized that he had put himself outside the pale of official protection, and was become technically a burglar.',\n",
       " ' He wondered if Chief Inspector Kerry would have approved; but he had outlined this plan of investigation for himself, and knew well that, if it were crowned by success, the end would be regarded as having justified the means.',\n",
       " ' On the other hand, in the event of detention he must personally bear the consequences of such irregular behaviour. He knew well, however, that his celebrated superior had achieved promotion by methods at least as irregular; and he knew that if he could but obtain evidence to account for the death of the man Cohen, and of the Chinaman Pi Lung, who had preceded him by the same mysterious path, the way of his obtaining it would not be too closely questioned.',\n",
       " ' He was an ambitious man, and consequently one who took big chances. Nothing disturbed the silence; he sat upon the divan and again pressed the button of his torch, shining it all about the low–beamed apartment and peering curiously into the weird shadows of the place.',\n",
       " ' He calculated he was now in the position which Cohen had occupied during the last moments of his life, and a sense of the uncanny touched him coldly. As he thought of the unnatural screams spoken of by Poland, some strange instinct prompted him to curl up his feet upon the divan again, as though a secret menace crawled upon the floor amid its many rugs and carpets.',\n",
       " ' He must now endeavour to reconstruct the plan upon which the American cracksman had operated. Poland had a persistent belief that Cohen had known where the fabled hoard of Huang Chow was concealed. Durham began a deliberate inspection of the place.',\n",
       " ' He thought it unlikely that a wily old Chinaman, assuming that he possessed hidden wealth, would keep it in so accessible a spot as this. It was far more probable that he had a fireproof safe in the room upstairs, perhaps built into the wall.',\n",
       " \" Yet, according to Poland's account, it was in this room and not in any other that death came to Diamond Fred. The wall–hangings first engaged Durham's attention. He moved them aside systematically, one after another, seeking for any hiding–place, but failing to find one.\",\n",
       " ' The door communicating with the outer office he found to be locked, but he did not believe for a moment that the office would be worthy of inspection. There were cases containing jewelled weapons and cups and goblets inlaid with precious stones, but none of these seemed to have been tampered with, and all were locked, as was the big cabinet filled with snuff bottles.',\n",
       " ' Many of the larger pieces about the place contained drawers and cupboards, and these he systematically opened one after another, without making any discovery of note. Some of the cupboards contained broken pieces of crockery, and more or less damaged curios of one kind and another, but none of them gave him the clue for which he was seeking.',\n",
       " ' He examined the couch upon which Huang Chow had been seated when first he had met him, but although he searched it scientifically he was rewarded by no discovery. A very fusty and unpleasant smell was more noticeable at this point than elsewhere in the room, and he found himself staring speculatively up the wide, carpeted stairs.',\n",
       " ' Next he turned his attention to the lacquered coffin which occupied the corresponding recess to that filled by the couch. It was an extraordinarily ornate piece of lacquer work and probably of great value.',\n",
       " ' The lid appeared to be screwed on, and Durham stood staring at the thing, half revolted and half fascinated. He failed to discover any means of opening it, however, and when he tried to move it bodily found it very heavy.',\n",
       " ' He came to the conclusion that all the portable valuables were contained in locked cases or cabinets, and out of this discovery grew an idea. The case containing the snuff bottles stood too close to the wall to enable him to test his new theory, but a square case near the office door, in which were five of six small but almost priceless pieces of porcelain, afforded the very evidence for which he was looking.',\n",
       " ' Thin electric flex descended from somewhere inside the case down one of the legs of the pedestal, and through a neatly drilled hole in the floor, evidently placed there to accommodate it. \"Burglar alarm!\" he muttered.',\n",
       " ' The opening of this case, and doubtless of any of the others, would set alarm bells ringing. This was not an unimportant discovery, but it brought him very little nearer to a solution of the chief problem which engaged his mind.',\n",
       " ' Assuming that Cohen had opened one of the cases and had alarmed old Huang Chow, what steps had the latter taken to deal with the intruder which had resulted in so ghastly a death? And how had he disposed of the body? As Durham stood there musing and looking down through the plate–glass at the delicate porcelain beneath, a faint sound intruded itself upon the stillness.',\n",
       " ' It gave him another idea. Part of the floor was stone–paved, but part was wood. Upon a portion of the latter, where no carpet rested, Durham dropped flat, pressing his ear to the floor. A faint swishing and trickling sound was perceptible from some place beneath.',\n",
       " ' \"Ah!\" he murmured. Remembering that the premises almost overhung the Thames, he divined that the cellars were flooded at high tide, or that there was some kind of drain or cutting running underneath the house.',\n",
       " ' He stood up again, listening intently for any sound within the building. He thought he had detected something, and now, as he stood there alert, he heard it again—a faint scuffling, which might have been occasioned by rats or even mice, but which, in some subtle and very unpleasant way, did not suggest the movements of these familiar rodents.',\n",
       " ' Even as he perceived it, it ceased, leaving him wondering, and uncomfortably conscious of a sudden dread of his surroundings. He wondered in what part of this mysterious house Lala resided, and recognizing that his departure must leave traces, he determined to prosecute his inquiries as far as possible, since another opportunity might not arise.',\n",
       " ' He was baffled but still hopeful. Something there was in the smell of the place which threatened to unnerve him; or perhaps in its silence, which remained quite unbroken save when, by acute listening, one detected the dripping of water.',\n",
       " ' That unexplained scuffling sound, too, which he had failed to trace or identify, lingered in his memory insistently, and for some reason contained the elements of fear. He crossed the room and began softly to mount the stair.',\n",

It was a typical Chinese apartment, containing very little furniture, the raised desk being the most noticeable item, except for a small shrine which faced it on the other side of the room.',\n",
       " ' He mounted the steps to the desk and inspected a number of loose papers which lay upon it. Without exception they were written in Chinese. A sort of large, dull white blotting–pad lay upon the table, but its surface was smooth and glossy.',\n",
       " ' Over it was suspended what looked like a lampshade, but on inspection it proved to contain no lamp, but to communicate, by a sort of funnel, with the ceiling above. At this contrivance Durham stared long and curiously, but without coming to any conclusion respecting its purpose.',\n",

       " ' At the foot his attention was again arrested by the faint scuffling sound. It ceased as suddenly as it had begun, leaving him wondering and conscious anew of a chill of apprehension. He had already made his plans for departure, but knew that they must leave evidence, when discovered, of his visit.',\n",
       " ' A large and solid table stood near the divan, and he moved this immediately under the trap. Upon it he laid a leopard–skin to deaden any noise he might make, and then upon the leopard–skin he set a massive chair: he replaced his torch in his pocket and drew himself up on to the roof again.',\n",
       " ' Reclosing the trap by means of the awl which he had screwed into it, he removed the awl and placed it in his pocket. Then, sliding gently down the sloping roof, he dropped back into the deserted court.',\n",

       " ' They were seated in a teashop patronized by the workers of the district; and as Durham, his elbows resting on the marble–topped table, looked into the dark eyes of his companion, he told himself again that whatever might be the secrets of old Huang Chow, his daughter did not share them.',\n",
       " ' The Chinaman had made no report to the authorities, although the piled up furniture beneath the skylight must have afforded conclusive evidence that a burglarious entry had been made into the premises.',\n",

       " ' After all, it rested upon very slender data—the mysterious death of a Chinaman whose history was unknown and the story of a crook whose word was worth nothing. Finally he asked himself, as he had asked himself before, what did it matter? If old Huang Chow had disposed of these people in some strange manner, they had sought to rob him.',\n",
       " \" The morality of the case was complicated and obscure, and more and more he was falling under the spell of Lala's dark eyes. But always it was his professional pride which came to the rescue. Murder had been done, whether justifiably or otherwise, and to him had been entrusted the discovery of the murderer.\",\n",
       " ' It seemed that failure was to be his lot, for if Lala knew anything she was a most consummate actress, and if she did not, his last hope of information was gone. He would have liked nothing better than to be rid of the affair, provided he could throw up the case with a clear conscience.',\n",
       " ' But when presently he parted from the attractive Eurasian, and watched her slim figure as, turning, she waved her hand and disappeared round a corner, he knew that rest was not for him. He had discovered the emporium of a Shadwell live–stock dealer with whom Ah Fu had a standing order for newly fledged birds of all descriptions.',\n",
       " ' Purchases apparently were always made after dusk, and Ah Fu with his birdcage was due that evening. A scheme having suggested itself to Durham, he now proceeded to put it into execution, so that when dusk came, and Ah Fu, carrying an empty birdcage, set out from the house of Huang Chow, a very dirty–looking loafer passed the corner of the street at about the time that the Chinaman came slinking out.',\n",
       " ' Durham had mentally calculated that Ah Fu would be gone about half an hour upon his mysterious errand, but the Chinaman travelled faster than he had calculated. Just as he was about to climb up once more on to the sloping roof, he heard the pattering footsteps returning to the courtyard, although rather less than twenty minutes had elapsed since the man had set out.',\n",

The place beneath became illuminated, not fully, by means of the hanging lamps, but dimly so that distorted shadows were cast about the floor.',\n",
       " \" Someone had entered carrying a lantern. Durham's view–point limited his area of vision, but presently, as the light came nearer and nearer, he discerned Ah Fu, carrying a lantern in one hand and a birdcage in the other.\",\n",
       " ' He could hear nothing, for the trap fitted well and the glass was thick. Moreover, it was very dirty. He was afraid, however, to attempt to clean a space. Ah Fu apparently had set the lantern upon a table, and into the radius of its light there presently moved a stooping figure.',\n",
       " ' Durham recognized Huang Chow, and felt his heart beats increasing in rapidity. Clutching the framework of the trap with his hands, he moved his head cautiously, so that presently he was enabled to see the two Chinamen.',\n",
       " \" They were standing beside the lacquered coffin upon its dragon–legged pedestal. Durham stifled an exclamation. One end of the ornate sarcophagus had been opened in some way! Now, to the watcher's unbounded astonishment, Ah Fu placed the birdcage in the opening, and apparently reclosed the trap in the end of the coffin.\",\n",
       " ' He made other manipulations with his bony yellow fingers, which Durham failed to comprehend. Finally the birdcage was withdrawn again, and as it was passed before the light of the lantern he saw that it was empty, whereas previously it had contained a number of tiny birds all huddled up together! The light gleamed upon the spectacles of Huang Chow.',\n",
       " ' Watching him, Durham saw him take out from a hidden drawer in the pedestal a long, slender key, insert it in a lock concealed by the ornate carving, and then slightly raise the lid which had so recently defied his own efforts.',\n",
       " ' He raised it only a few inches, and then, taking up the lantern, peered into the interior of the coffin, at the same time waving his hand in dismissal to Ah Fu. For a while he stood there, peering into the interior, and then, lowering the lid again, he relocked this gruesome receptacle and, lantern in hand, began to mount the stair.',\n",
       " ' Durham inhaled deeply. He realized that during the last few seconds he had been holding his breath. Now, as he began to creep back down the slope, he discovered that his hands were shaking. He dropped down into the court again, and for several minutes leaned against the wall, endeavouring to reason out an explanation of what he had seen, and in a measure to regain his composure.',\n",
       " ' There was a horror underlying it all which he was half afraid to face. But the real clue to the mystery still eluded him. Whether what he had witnessed were some kind of obscene ceremony, or whether an explanation more vile must be sought, he remained undetermined.',\n",
       " ' He must repeat his exploit, if possible, and once more gain access to the room which contained the lacquer coffin. But the adventure was very distasteful. He recollected the smell of the place, and the memory brought with it a sense of nausea.',\n",
       " ' He thought of Lala Huang, and his ideas became grotesque and chaotic. Yet the solution of the mystery lay at last within his grasp, and to the zest of the investigator everything else became subjugated.',\n",

She knew that he had held high rank in China before she had been born; but that he had sacrificed his rights in some way had always been her theory.

       " ' She had decided that cruelty was his vice. In what way he gratified it she had never learned, nor did she desire to do so. There were periodical visits from the police, but she had learned long ago that her father was too clever to place himself within reach of the law.',\n",

It was curious, she reflected, that Huang Chow never checked—indeed, openly countenanced—her friendship with the many chance acquaintances she had made, even when her own instincts told her that the men were crooked; so that, knowing the acumen of her father, she was well aware that he must know it too.',\n",
       " ' Several of these pseudo lovers of hers had died. It was a point which often occurred to her mind, but upon which she did not care to dwell even now. But John Hampden—John Hampden was different. He was not wholly sincere.',\n",

       " '\" In a few moments, led by the sergeant, the party came dropping heavily through the skylight into the treasure–house of Huang Chow, in which every lamp was now alight. A trap was open near the foot of the stairs, and from beneath it muffled cries proceeded.',\n",

       " ' Look to the girl, though, first. Look to the girl!\" The sergeant turned to where, stretched upon a tiger skin before a half–open door, Lala Huang lay, scantily clothed and white as death. Upon one of her bare ankles was a discoloured mark.',\n",
       " ' As the sergeant and another of the men stooped over her a moaning sound drew their attention to the stair, and there, bent and tottering slowly down, was old Huang Chow, his eyes peering through the owl–like glasses vacantly across the room to where his daughter lay.',\n",

He looked blankly into the face of the other man. \"She\\'s dead!\" Two plain–clothes men were busy knotting together tapestries and pieces of rare stuff with which to draw Durham out of the pit; but at these old Huang Chow looked not at all, but gropingly crossed the room, as if he saw imperfectly, or could not believe what he saw.',\n",
       " ' At last he reached the side of the dead girl, stooped, touched her, laid a trembling yellow hand over her heart, and then stood up again, looking from face to face.

       " ' \"What\\'s that?\" He had seen the giant spider, the horror from Surinam, which the Chinaman had reared and fed to guard his treasure and to gratify his lust for the strange and cruel. The insect, like everything else in that house, was unusual, almost unique.',\n",
       " ' It was one of the Black Soldier spiders, by some regarded as a native myth, but actually existing in Surinam and parts of Brazil. A member of the family, Mygale, its sting was more quickly and certainly fatal than that of a rattle–snake.',\n",

Presently another line of cars proclaimed the entrance to a club, and just before reaching the first of these Kerry paused.',\n",
       " ' A man stood in a shadowy doorway, and: \"Good evening, Chief Inspector,\" he said quietly. \"Good evening, Durham. Anything to report?\" \"Yes. Lou Chada is here again.\" \"With whom?\" \"Lady Rourke.\" Kerry stepped to the edge of the pavement and spat out a piece of chewing–gum.',\n",
       " ' From his overcoat pocket he drew a fresh piece, tore off the pink wrapping and placed the gum between his teeth. Then: \"How long?\" he demanded. \"Came to dinner. They are dancing.\" \"H\\'m!\" The Chief Inspector ranged himself beside the other detective in the shadow of the doorway.',\n",
       " ' \"Something\\'s brewing, Durham,\" he said. \"I think I shall wait.\" His subordinate stared curiously but made no reply. He was not wholly in his chief\\'s confidence. He merely knew that the name of Lou Chada to Kerry was like a red rag to a bull.',\n",
       " \" The handsome, cultured young Eurasian, fresh from a distinguished university career and pampered by a certain section of smart society, did not conform to Detective Sergeant Durham's idea of a suspect.\",\n",
       " ' He knew that Lou was the son of Zani Chada, and he knew that Zani Chada was one of the wealthiest men in Limehouse. But Lou had an expensive flat in George Street; Lou was courted by society butterflies, and in what way he could be connected with the case known as \"the Limehouse inquiry,\" Durham could not imagine.',\n",
       " ' That the open indiscretion of Lady \"Pat\" Rourke might lead to trouble with her husband, was conceivable enough; but this was rather a matter for underhand private inquiry than for the attention of the Criminal Investigation Department of New Scotland Yard.',\n",
       " ' So mused Durham, standing cold and uncomfortable in the shadowy doorway, and dreaming of a certain cosy fireside, a pair of carpet slippers and a glass of hot toddy which awaited him. Suddenly: \"Great flames! Look!\" he cried.',\n",
       " \" Kerry's fingers closed, steely, upon Durham's wrist. A porter was urgently moving the parked cars farther along the street to enable one, a French coupe, to draw up before the club entrance. Two men came out, supporting between them a woman who seemed to be ill; a slender, blonde woman whose pretty face was pale and whose wide–open blue eyes stared strangely straight before her.\",\n",
       " ' The taller of her escorts, while continuing to support her, solicitously wrapped her fur cloak about her bare shoulders; the other, the manager of the club, stepped forward and opened the door of the car.',\n",
       " ' \"Lady Rourke!\" whispered Durham. \"With Lou Chada!\" rapped Kerry. \"Run for a cab. Brisk. Don\\'t waste a second.\" Some little conversation ensued between manager and patron, then the tall, handsome Eurasian, waving his hand protestingly, removed his hat and stepped into the coupe beside Lady Rourke.',\n",
       " ' It immediately moved away in the direction of Piccadilly. One glimpse Kerry had of the pretty, fair head lying limply back against the cushions. The manager of the club was staring after the car. Kerry stepped out from his hiding place.',\n",
       " ' Durham had disappeared, and there was no cab in sight, but immediately beyond the illuminated entrance stood a Rolls–Royce which had been fifth in the rank of parked cars before the adjustment had been made to enable the coupe to reach the door.',\n",
       " ' Kerry ran across, and: \"Whose car, my lad?\" he demanded of the chauffeur. The latter, resenting the curt tone of the inquiry, looked the speaker up and down, and: \"Captain. Egerton\\'s,\" he replied slowly.',\n",
       " ' \"But what business may it be of yours?\" \"I\\'m Chief Inspector Kerry, of New Scotland Yard,\" came the rapid reply. \"I want to follow the car that has just left.\" \"What about running?\" demanded the man insolently.',\n",
       " ' Kerry shot out a small, muscular hand and grasped the speaker\\'s wrist. \"I\\'ll say one thing to you,\" he rapped. \"I\\'m a police officer, and I demand your help. Refuse it, and you\\'ll wake up in Vine Street.',\n",
       " '\" The Chief Inspector was on the step now, bending forward so that his fierce red face was but an inch removed from that of the startled chauffeur. The quelling force of his ferocious personality achieved its purpose, as it rarely failed to do.',\n",
       " ' \"I\\'m getting in,\" added the Chief Inspector, jumping back on to the pavement. \"Lose that French bus, and I\\'ll charge you with resisting and obstructing an officer of the law in the execution of his duty.',\n",
       " ' Start.\" Kerry leaped in and banged the door—and the Rolls–Royce started..',\n",
       " \"II: At Malay Jack's When Kerry left Bond Street the mistiness of the night was developing into definite fog. It varied in different districts. Thus, St. Paul's Churchyard had been clear of it at a time when it had lain impenetrably in Trafalgar Square.\",\n",
       " ' When, an hour and a half after setting out in the commandeered Rolls–Royce, Kerry groped blindly along Limehouse Causeway, it was through a yellow murk that he made his way—a vapour which could not only be seen, smelled and felt, but tasted.',\n",
       " ' He was in one of his most violent humours. He found some slight solace in the reflection that the impudent chauffeur, from whom he had parted in West India Dock Road, must experience great difficulty in finding his way back to the West End.',\n",
       " ' \"Damn the fog!\" he muttered, coughing irritably. It had tricked him, this floating murk of London; for, while he had been enabled to keep the coupe in view right to the fringe of dockland, here, as if bred by old London\\'s river, the fog had lain impenetrably.',\n",
       " \" Chief Inspector Kerry was a man who took many risks, but because of this cursed fog he had no definite evidence that Chada's car had gone to a certain house. Right of search he had not, and so temporarily he was baffled.\",\n",
       " ' Now the nearest telephone was his objective, and presently, where a blue light dimly pierced the mist, he paused, pushed open a swing door, and stepped into a long, narrow passage. He descended three stairs, and entered a room laden with a sickly perfume compounded of stale beer and spirits; of greasy humanity—European, Asiastic, and African; of cheap tobacco and cheaper scents; and, vaguely, of opium.',\n",
       " \" It was fairly well lighted, but the fog had penetrated here, veiling some of the harshness of its rough appointments. An unsavoury den was Malay Jack's, where flotsam of the river might be found. Yellow men there were, and black men and brown men.\",\n",
       " \" But all the women present were white. Fan–tan was in progress at one of the tables, the four players being apparently the only strictly sober people in the room. A woman was laughing raucously as Kerry entered, and many coarse–voiced conversations were in progress; but as he pulled the rough curtain walls aside and walked into the room, a hush, highly complimentary to the Chief Inspector's reputation, fell upon the assembly.\",\n",
       " ' Only the woman\\'s raucous laughter continued, rising, a hideous solo, above a sort of murmur, composed of the words \"Red Kerry!\" spoken in many tones. Kerry ignored the sensation which his entrance had created, and crossed the room to a small counter, behind which a dusky man was standing, coatless and shirt sleeves rolled up.',\n",
       " ' He had the skin of a Malay but the features of a stage Irishman of the old school. And, indeed, had he known his own pedigree, which is a knowledge beyond the ken of any man, partly Irish he might have found himself indeed to be.',\n",
       " ' This was Malay Jack, the proprietor of one of the roughest houses in Limehouse. His expression, while propitiatory, was not friendly, but: \"Don\\'t get hot and bothered,\" snapped Kerry viciously. \"I want to use your telephone, that\\'s all.',\n",
       " '\" \"Oh,\" said the other, unable to conceal his relief, \"that\\'s easy. Come in.\" He raised a flap in the counter, and Kerry, passing through, entered a little room behind the bar. Here a telephone stood upon a dirty, littered table, and, taking it up: \"City four hundred,\" called the Chief Inspector curtly.',\n",
       " ' A moment later: \"Hallo! Yes,\" he said. \"Chief Inspector Kerry speaking. Put me through to my department, please.\" He stood for a while waiting, receiver in hand, and smiled grimly to note that the uproar in the room beyond had been resumed.',\n",
       " ' Evidently Malay Jack had given the \"all clear\" signal. Then: \"Chief Inspector Kerry speaking,\" he said again. \"Has Detective Sergeant Durham reported?\" \"Yes,\" was the reply, \"half an hour ago. He\\'s standing–by at Limehouse Station.',\n",
       " ' He followed you in a taxi, but lost you on the way owing to the fog.\" \"I don\\'t wonder,\" said Kerry. \"His loss is not so great as mine. Anything else?\" \"Nothing else.\" \"Good. I\\'ll speak to Limehouse. Good–bye.',\n",
       " '\" He replaced the receiver and paused for a moment, reflecting. Extracting a piece of tasteless gum from between his teeth, he deposited it in the grate, where a sickly fire burned; then, tearing the wrapper from a fresh slip, he resumed his chewing and stood looking about him with unseeing eyes.',\n",
       " ' Fierce they were as ever, but introspective in expression. Famous for his swift decisions, for once in a way he found himself in doubt. Malay Jack had keen ears, and there were those in the place who had every reason to be interested in the movements of a member of the Criminal Investigation Department, especially of one who had earned the right to be dreaded by the rats of Limehouse.',\n",
       " \" London's peculiar climate fought against him, but he determined to make no more telephone calls but to proceed to Limehouse police station. He stepped swiftly into the bar, and, as he had anticipated, nearly upset the proprietor, who was standing listening by the half–open door.\",\n",
       " ' Kerry smiled fiercely into the ugly face, lifted the flap, and walked down the room, through the aisle between the scattered tables, where the air was heavy with strange perfumes, touched now with the bite of London fog, and where slanting eyes and straight eyes, sober eyes and drunken eyes, regarded him furtively.',\n",
       " ' Something of a second hush there was, but one not so complete as the first. Kerry pulled the curtain aside, mounted the stair, walked along the passage and out through the swing door into the yellow gloom of the Causeway.',\n",
       " ' Ten slow steps he had taken when he detected a sound of pursuit. Like a flash he turned, clenching his fists. Then: \"Inspector!\" whispered a husky voice. \"Yes! Who are you? What do you want?\" A dim form loomed up through the fog.',\n",
       " ' \"My name is Peters, sir. Inspector Preston knows me.\" Kerry had paused immediately under a street lamp, and now he looked into the pinched, lean face of the speaker, and: \"I\\'ve heard of you,\" he snapped.',\n",
       " ' \"Got some information for me?\" \"I think so; but walk on.\" Chief Inspector Kerry hesitated. Peters belonged to a class which Kerry despised with all the force of his straightforward character. A professional informer has his uses from the police point of view; and while evidence of this kind often figured in reports made to the Chief Inspector, he personally avoided contact with such persons, as he instinctively and daintily avoided contact with personal dirt.',\n",
       " \" But now, something so big was at stake that his hesitation was only momentary. A vision of the pale face of Lady Rourke, of the golden head leaning weakly back upon the cushions of the coupe, as he had glimpsed it in Bond Street, rose before his mind's eye as if conjured up out of the fog.\",\n",
       " ' Peters shuffled along beside him, and: \"Young Chada\\'s done himself in to–night,\" continued the husky voice. \"He brought a swell girl to the old man\\'s house an hour ago. I was hanging about there, thinking I might get some information.',\n",
       " ' I think she was doped.\" \"Why?\" snapped Kerry. \"Well, I was standing over on the other side of the street. Lou Chada opened the door with a key; and when the light shone out I saw him carry her in.\" \"Carry her in?\" \"Yes.',\n",
       " ' She was in evening dress, with a swell cloak.\" \"The car?\" \"He came out again and drove it around to the garage at the back.\" \"Why didn\\'t you report this at once?\" \"I was on my way to do it when I saw you coming out of Malay Jack\\'s.',\n",
       " '\" The man\\'s voice shook nervously, and: \"What are you scared about?\" asked Kerry savagely. \"Got anything else to tell me?\" \"No, no,\" muttered Peters. \"Only I\\'ve got an idea he saw me.\" \"Who saw you?\" \"Lou Chada.',\n",
       " '\" \"What then?\" \"Well, only—don\\'t leave me till we get to the station.\" Kerry blew down his nose contemptuously, then stopped suddenly. \"Stand still,\" he ordered. \"I want to listen.\" Silent, they stood in a place of darkness, untouched by any lamplight.',\n",
       " ' Not a sound reached them through the curtain of fog. Asiatic mystery wrapped them about, but Kerry experienced only contempt for the cowardice of his companion, and: \"You need come no farther,\" he said coldly.',\n",
       " ' \"Good night.\" \"But―—\" began the man. \"Good night,\" repeated Kerry. He walked on briskly, tapping the pavement with his malacca. The sneaking figure of the informer was swallowed up in the fog. But not a dozen paces had the Chief Inspector gone when he was arrested by a frenzied scream, rising, hollowly, in a dreadful, muffled crescendo.',\n",
       " ' Words reached him. \"My God, he\\'s stabbed me!\" Then came a sort of babbling, which died into a moan. \"Hell!\" muttered Kerry, \"the poor devil was right!\" He turned and began to run back, fumbling in his pocket for his electric torch.',\n",
       " ' Almost in the same moment that he found it he stumbled upon Peters, who lay half in the road and half upon the sidewalk. Kerry pressed the button, and met the glance of upturned, glazing eyes. Even as he dropped upon his knee beside the dying man, Peters swept his arm around in a convulsive movement, having the fingers crooked, coughed horribly, and rolled upon his face.',\n",
       " ' Switching off the light of the torch, Kerry clenched his jaws in a tense effort of listening, literally holding his breath. But no sound reached him through the muffling fog. A moment he hesitated, well knowing his danger, then viciously snapping on the light again, he quested in the blood–stained mud all about the body of the murdered man.',\n",
       " ' \"Ah!\" It was an exclamation of triumph. One corner hideously stained, for it had lain half under Peters\\'s shoulder, Kerry gingerly lifted between finger and thumb a handkerchief of fine white silk, such as is carried in the breast pocket of an evening coat.',\n",
       " ' It bore an ornate monogram worked in gold, and representing the letters \"L. C.\" Oddly enough, it was the corner that bore the monogram which was also bloodstained..',\n",
       " 'III: The Room of the Golden Buddha It was a moot point whether Lady Pat Rourke merited condemnation or pity. She possessed that type of blonde beauty which seems to be a lodestone for mankind in general.',\n",
       " ' Her husband was wealthy, twelve years her senior, and, far from watching over her with jealous care—an attitude which often characterizes such unions—he, on the contrary, permitted her a dangerous freedom, believing that she would appreciate without abusing it.',\n",
       " ' Her friendship with Lou Chada had first opened his eyes to the perils which beset the road of least resistance. Sir Noel Rourke was an Anglo–Indian, and his prejudice against the Eurasian was one not lightly to be surmounted.',\n",
       " ' Not all the polish which English culture had given to this child of a mixed union could blind Sir Noel to the yellow streak. Courted though Chada was by some of the best people, Sir Noel remained cold.',\n",
       " ' The long, magnetic eyes, the handsome, clear–cut features, above all, that slow and alluring smile, appealed to the husband of the wilful Pat rather as evidences of Oriental, half–effeminate devilry than as passports to decent society.',\n",
       " ' Oxford had veneered him, but scratch the veneer and one found the sandal–wood of the East, perfumed, seductive, appealing, but something to be shunned as brittle and untrustworthy. Yet he hesitated, seeking to be true to his convictions.',\n",
       " ' Knowing what he knew already, and what he suspected, it is certain that, could he have viewed Lou Chada through the eyes of Chief Inspector Kerry, the affair must have terminated otherwise. But Sir Noel did not know what Kerry knew.',\n",
       " ' And the pleasure–seeking Lady Rourke, with her hair of spun gold and her provoking smile, found Lou Chada dangerously fascinating; almost she was infatuated—she who had known so much admiration. Of those joys for which thousands of her plainer sisters yearn and starve to the end of their days she had experienced a surfeit.',\n",
       " \" Always she sought for novelty, for new adventures. She was confident of herself, but yet—and here lay the delicious thrill—not wholly confident. Many times she had promised to visit the house of Lou Chada's father—a mystery palace cunningly painted, a perfumed page from the Arabian poets dropped amid the interesting squalor of Limehouse.\",\n",
       " ' Perhaps she had never intended to go. Who knows? But on the night when she came within the ken of Chief Inspector Kerry, Lou Chada had urged her to do so in his poetically passionate fashion, and, wanting to go, she had asked herself: \"Am I strong enough? Dare I?\" They had dined, danced, and she had smoked one of the scented cigarettes which he alone seemed to be able to procure, and which, on their arrival from the East, were contained in queer little polished wooden boxes.',\n",
       " ' Then had come an unfamiliar nausea and dizziness, an uncomfortable recognition of the fact that she was making a fool of herself, and finally a semi–darkness through which familiar faces loomed up and were quickly lost again.',\n",
       " ' There was the soft, musical voice of Lou Chada reassuring her, a sense of chill, of helplessness, and then for a while an interval which afterward she found herself unable to bridge. Knowledge of verity came at last, and Lady Pat raised herself from the divan upon which she had been lying, and, her slender hands clutching the cushions, stared about her with eyes which ever grew wider.',\n",
       " ' She was in a long, rather lofty room, which was lighted by three silver lanterns swung from the ceiling. The place, without containing much furniture, was a riot of garish, barbaric colour. There were deep divans cushioned in amber and blood–red.',\n",
       " ' Upon the floor lay Persian carpets and skins of beasts. Cunning niches there were, half concealing and half revealing long–necked Chinese jars; and odd little carven tables bore strangely fashioned vessels of silver.',\n",
       " ' There was a cabinet of ebony inlaid with jade, there were black tapestries figured with dragons of green and gold. Curtains she saw of peacock–blue; and in a tall, narrow recess, dominating the room, squatted a great golden Buddha.',\n",
       " ' The atmosphere was laden with a strange perfume. But, above all, this room was silent, most oppressively silent. Lady Pat started to her feet. The whole perfumed place seemed to be swimming around her.',\n",
       " ' Reclosing her eyes, she fought down her weakness. The truth, the truth respecting Lou Chada and herself, had uprisen starkly before her. By her own folly—and she could find no tiny excuse—she had placed herself in the power of a man whom, instinctively, deep within her soul, she had always known to be utterly unscrupulous.',\n",
       " ' How cleverly he had concealed the wild animal which dwelt beneath that suave, polished exterior! Yet how ill he had concealed it! For intuitively she had always recognized its presence, but had deliberately closed her eyes, finding a joy in the secret knowledge of danger.',\n",
       " ' Now at last he had discarded pretense. The cigarette which he had offered her at the club had been drugged. She was in Limehouse, at the mercy of a man in whose veins ran the blood of ancestors to whom women had been chattels.',\n",
       " ' Too well she recognized that his passion must have driven him insane, as he must know at what cost he took such liberties with one who could not lightly be so treated. But these reflections afforded poor consolation.',\n",
       " ' It was not of the penalties that Lou Chada must suffer for this infringement of Western codes, but of the price that she must pay for her folly, of which Pat was thinking. There was a nauseating taste upon her palate.',\n",
       " ' She remembered having noticed it faintly while she was smoking the cigarette; indeed, she had commented upon it at the time. \"The dirty yellow blackguard!\" she said aloud, and clenched her hands. She merely echoed what many a man had said before her.',\n",
       " ' She wondered at herself, and in doing so but wondered at the mystery of womanhood. Clarity was returning. The room no longer swam around her. She crossed in the direction of a garish curtain, which instinctively she divined to mask a door.',\n",
       " ' Dragging it aside, she tried the handle, but the door was locked. A second door she found, and this also proved to be locked. There was one tall window, also covered by ornate draperies, but it was shuttered, and the shutters had locks.',\n",
       " ' Another small window she discovered, glazed with amber glass, but set so high in the wall as to be inaccessible. Dread assailed her, and dropping on to one of the divans, she hid her face in her hands.',\n",
       " ' \"My God!\" she whispered. \"My God! Give me strength—give me courage.\" For a long time she remained there, listening for any sound which should disperse the silence. She thought of her husband, of the sweet security of her home, of the things which she had forfeited because of this mad quest of adventure.',\n",
       " ' And presently a key grated in a lock. Lady Pat started to her feet with a wild, swift action which must have reminded a beholder of a startled gazelle. The drapery masking the door which she had first investigated was drawn aside.',\n",
       " ' A man entered and dropped the curtain behind him. Exactly what she had expected she could not have defined, but the presence of this perfect stranger was a complete surprise. The man, who wore embroidered slippers and a sort of long blue robe, stood there regarding her with an expression which, even in her frantic condition, she found to be puzzling.',\n",
       " ' He had long, untidy gray hair brushed back from his low brow; eyes strangely like the eyes of Lou Chada, except that they were more heavy–lidded; but his skin was as yellow as a guinea, and his gaunt, cleanshaven face was the face of an Oriental.',\n",
       " ' The slender hands, too, which he held clasped before him, were yellow, and possessed a curiously arresting quality. Pat imagined them clasped about her white throat, and her very soul seemed to shrink from the man who stood there looking at her with those long, magnetic, inscrutable eyes.',\n",
       " ' She wondered why she was surprised, and suddenly realized that it was because of the expression in his eyes, for it was an expression of cold anger. Then the intruder spoke. \"Who are you?\" he demanded, speaking with an accent which was unfamiliar to her, but in a voice which was not unlike the voice of Lou Chada.',\n",
       " ' \"Who brought you here?\" This was so wholly unexpected that for a moment she found herself unable to reply, but finally: \"How dare you!\" she cried, her native courage reasserting itself. \"I have been drugged and brought to this place.',\n",
       " ' You shall pay for it. How dare you!\" \"Ah!\" The long, dark eyes regarded her unmovingly. \"But who are you?\" \"I am Lady Rourke. Open the door. You shall bitterly regret this outrage.\" \"You are Lady Rourke?\" the man repeated.',\n",
       " ' \"Before you speak of regrets, answer the question which I have asked: Who brought you here?\" \"Lou Chada.\" \"Ah!\" There was no alteration of pose, no change of expression, but slightly the intonation had varied.',\n",
       " ' \"I don\\'t know who you are, but I demand to be released from this place instantly.\" The man standing before the curtained door slightly inclined his head. \"You shall be released,\" he replied, \"but not instantly.',\n",
       " ' I will see the one who brought you here. He may not be entirely to blame. Before you leave we shall understand one another.\" Tone and glance were coldly angry. Then, before the frightened woman could say another word, the man in the blue robe robe withdrew, the curtain was dropped again, and she heard the grating of a key in the lock.',\n",
       " ' She ran to the door, beating upon it with her clenched hands. \"Let me go!\" she cried, half hysterically. \"Let me go! You shall pay for this! Oh, you shall pay for this!\" No one answered, and, turning, she leaned back against the curtain, breathing heavily and fighting for composure, for strength.',\n",
       " 'IV: Zani Chada, the Eurasian \"I can\\'t help thinking, Chief Inspector,\" said the officer in charge at Limehouse Station, \"that you take unnecessary risks.\" \"Can\\'t you?\" said Kerry, tilting his bowler farther forward and staring truculently at the speaker.',\n",
       " ' \"No, I can\\'t. Since you cleaned up the dope gang down here you\\'ve been a marked man. These murders in the Chinatown area, of which this one to–night makes the third, have got some kind of big influence behind them.',\n",
       " ' Yet you wander about in the fog without even a gun in your pocket.\" \"I don\\'t believe in guns,\" rapped Kerry. \"My bare hands are good enough for any yellow smart in this area. And if they give out I can kick like a mule.',\n",
       " '\" The other laughed, shaking his head. \"It\\'s silly, all the same,\" he persisted. \"The man who did the job out there in the fog to–night might have knifed you or shot you long before you could have got here.',\n",
       " '\" \"He might,\" snapped Kerry, \"but he didn\\'t.\" Yet, remembering his wife, who would be waiting for him in the cosy sitting–room he knew a sudden pang. Perhaps he did take unnecessary chances. Others had said so.',\n",
       " ' Hard upon the thought came the memory of his boy, and of the telephone message which the episodes of the night had prevented him from sending. He remembered, too, something which his fearless nature had prompted him to forget: he remembered how, just as he had arisen from beside the body of the murdered man, oblique eyes had regarded him swiftly out of the fog.',\n",
       " \" He had lashed out with a boxer's instinct, but his knuckles had encountered nothing but empty air. No sound had come to tell him that the thing had not been an illusion. Only, once again, as he groped his way through the shuttered streets of Chinatown and the silence of the yellow mist, something had prompted him to turn; and again he had detected the glint of oblique eyes, and faintly had discerned the form of one who followed him.\",\n",
       " ' Kerry chewed viciously, then: \"I think I\\'ll \\'phone the wife,\" he said abruptly. \"She\\'ll be expecting me.\" Almost before he had finished speaking the \\'phone bell rang, and a few moments later: \"Someone to speak to you, Chief Inspector,\" cried the officer in charge.',\n",
       " ' \"Ah!\" exclaimed Kerry, his fierce eyes lighting up. \"That will be from home.\" \"I don\\'t think so,\" was the reply. \"But see who it is.\" \"Hello!\" he called. He was answered by an unfamiliar voice, a voice which had a queer, guttural intonation.',\n",
       " ' It was the sort of voice he had learned to loathe. \"Is that Chief Inspector Kerry?\" \"Yes,\" he snapped. \"May I take it that what I have to say will be treated in confidence?\" \"Certainly not.\" \"Think again, Chief Inspector,\" the voice continued.',\n",
       " ' \"You are a man within sight of the ambition of years, and although you may be unaware of the fact, you stand upon the edge of a disaster. I appreciate your sense of duty and respect it. But there are times when diplomacy is a more potent weapon than force.',\n",
       " '\" Kerry, listening, became aware that the speaker was a man of cultured intellect. He wondered greatly, but: \"My time is valuable,\" he said rapidly. \"Come to the point. What do you want and who are you?\" \"One moment, Chief Inspector.',\n",
       " ' An opportunity to make your fortune without interfering with your career has come in your way. You have obtained possession of what you believe to be a clue to a murder.\" The voice ceased, and Kerry remaining silent, immediately continued: \"Knowing your personal character, I doubt if you have communicated the fact of your possessing this evidence to anyone else.',\n",
       " ' I suggest, in your own interests, that before doing so you interview me.\" Kerry thought rapidly, and then: \"I don\\'t say you\\'re right,\" he rapped back. \"But if I come to see you, I shall leave a sealed statement in possession of the officer in charge here.',\n",
       " '\" \"To this I have no objection,\" the guttural voice replied, \"but I beg of you to bring the evidence with you.\" \"I\\'m not to be bought,\" warned Kerry. \"Don\\'t think it and don\\'t suggest it, or when I get to you I\\'ll break you in half.',\n",
       " '\" His red moustache positively bristled, and he clutched the receiver so tightly that it quivered against his ear. \"You mistake me,\" replied the speaker. \"My name is Zani Chada. You know where I live. I shall not detain you more than five minutes if you will do me the honour of calling upon me.',\n",
       " '\" Kerry chewed furiously for ten momentous seconds, then: \"I\\'ll come!\" he said. He replaced the receiver on the hook, and, walking across to the charge desk, took an official form and a pen. On the back of the form he scribbled rapidly, watched with curiosity by the officer in charge.',\n",
       " ' \"Give me an envelope,\" he directed. An envelope was found and handed to him. He placed the paper in the envelope, gummed down the lapel, and addressed it in large, bold writing to the Assistant Commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Department, who was his chief.',\n",
       " ' Finally: \"I\\'m going out,\" he explained. \"After what I\\'ve said?\" \"After what you\\'ve said. I\\'m going out. If I don\\'t come back or don\\'t telephone within the next hour, you will know what to do with this.',\n",
       " '\" The Limehouse official stared perplexedly. \"But meanwhile,\" he protested, \"what steps am I to take about the murder? Durham will be back with the body at any moment now, and you say you\\'ve got a clue to the murderer.',\n",
       " '\" \"I have,\" said Kerry, \"but I\\'m going to get definite evidence. Do nothing until you hear from me.\" \"Very good,\" answered the other, and Kerry, tucking his malacca cane under his arm, strode out into the fog.',\n",
       " ' His knowledge of the Limehouse area was extensive and peculiar, so that twenty minutes later, having made only one mistake in the darkness, he was pressing an electric bell set beside a door which alone broke the expanse of a long and dreary brick wall, lining a street which neither by day nor night would have seemed inviting to the casual visitor.',\n",
       " ' The door was opened by a Chinaman wearing national dress, revealing a small, square lobby, warmly lighted and furnished Orientally. Kerry stepped in briskly. \"I want to see Mr. Zani Chada. Tell him I am here.',\n",
       " ' Chief Inspector Kerry is my name.\" The Chinaman bowed, crossed the lobby, and, drawing some curtains aside, walked up four carpeted stairs and disappeared into a short passage revealed by the raising of the tapestry.',\n",
       " ' As he did so Kerry stared about him curiously. He had never before entered the mystery house of Zani Chada, nor had he personally encountered the Eurasian, reputed to be a millionaire, but who chose, for some obscure reason, to make his abode in this old rambling building, once a country mansion, which to–day was closely invested by dockland and the narrow alleys of Chinatown.',\n",
       " ' It was curiously still in the lobby, and, as he determined, curiously Eastern. He was conscious of a sense of exhilaration. That Zani Chada controlled powerful influences, he knew well. But, reviewing the precautions which he had taken, Kerry determined that the trump card was in his possession.',\n",
       " ' The Chinese servant descended the stairs again and intimated that the visitor should follow him. Kerry, carrying his hat and cane, mounted the stairs, walked along the carpeted passage, and was ushered into a queer, low room furnished as a library.',\n",
       " ' It was lined with shelves containing strange–looking books, none of which appeared to be English. Upon the top of the shelves were grotesque figures of gods, pieces of Chinese pottery and other Oriental ornaments.',\n",
       " ' Arms there were in the room, and rich carpets, carven furniture, and an air of luxury peculiarly exotic. Furthermore, he detected a faint smell of opium from which fact he divined that Zani Chada was addicted to the national vice of China.',\n",
       " ' Seated before a long narrow table was the notorious Eurasian. The table contained a number of strange and unfamiliar objects, as well as a small rack of books. An opium pipe rested in a porcelain bowl.',\n",
       " ' Zani Chada, wearing a blue robe, sat in a cushioned chair, staring toward the Chief Inspector. With one slender yellow hand he brushed his untidy gray hair. His long magnetic eyes were half closed. \"Good evening, Chief Inspector Kerry,\" he said.',\n",
       " ' \"Won\\'t you be seated?\" \"Thanks, I\\'m not staying. I can hear what you\\'ve got to say standing.\" The long eyes grew a little more narrow—the only change of expression that Zani Chada allowed himself. \"As you wish.',\n",
       " ' I have no occasion to detain you long.\" In that queer, perfumed room, with the suggestion of something sinister underlying its exotic luxury, arose a kind of astral clash as the powerful personality of the Eurasian came in contact with that of Kerry.',\n",
       " ' In a sense it was a contest of rapier and battle–axe; an insidious but powerful will enlisted against the bulldog force of the Chief Inspector. Still through half–closed eyes Zani Chada watched his visitor, who stood, feet apart and chin thrust forward aggressively, staring with wide open, fierce blue eyes at the other.',\n",
       " ' \"I\\'m going to say one thing,\" declared Kerry, snapping out the words in a manner little short of ferocious. He laid his hat and cane upon a chair and took a step in the direction of the narrow, laden table.',\n",
       " ' \"Make me any kind of offer to buy back the evidence you think I\\'ve got, and I\\'ll bash your face as flat as a frying–pan.\" The yellow hands of Zani Chada clutched the metal knobs which ornamented the arms of the chair in which he was seated.',\n",
       " ' The long eyes now presented the appearance of being entirely closed; otherwise he remained immovable. Following a short, portentous silence: \"How grossly you misunderstood me, Chief Inspector,\" Chada replied, speaking very softly.',\n",
       " ' \"You are shortly to be promoted to a post which no one is better fitted to occupy. You enjoy great domestic happiness, and you possess a son in whom you repose great hopes. In this respect Chief Inspector, I resemble you.',\n",
       " '\" Kerry\\'s nostrils were widely dilated, but he did not speak. \"You see,\" continued the Eurasian, \"I know many things about you. Indeed, I have watched your career with interest. Now, to be brief, a great scandal may be averted and a woman\\'s reputation preserved if you and I, as men of the world, can succeed in understanding one another.',\n",
       " '\" \"I don\\'t want to understand you,\" said Kerry bluntly. \"But you\\'ve said enough already to justify me in blowing this whistle.\" He drew a police whistle from his overcoat pocket. \"This house is being watched.',\n",
       " '\" \"I am aware of the fact,\" murmured Zani Chada. \"There are two people in it I want for two different reasons. If you say much more there may be three.\" Chada raised his hand slowly. \"Put back your whistle, Chief Inspector.',\n",
       " '\" There was a curious restraint in the Eurasian\\'s manner which Kerry distrusted, but for which at the time he was at a loss to account. Then suddenly he determined that the man was waiting for something, listening for some sound.',\n",
       " \" As if to confirm this reasoning, just at that moment a sound indeed broke the silence of the room. Somewhere far away in the distance of the big house a gong was beaten three times softly. Kerry's fierce glance searched the face of Zani Chada, but it remained mask–like, immovable.\",\n",
       " ' Yet that this had been a signal of some kind the Chief Inspector did not doubt, and: \"You can\\'t trick me,\" he said fiercely. \"No one can leave this house without my knowledge, and because of what happened out there in the fog my hands are untied.',\n",
       " '\" He took up his hat and cane from the chair. \"I\\'m going to search the premises,\" he declared. Zani Chada stood up slowly. \"Chief Inspector,\" he said, \"I advise you to do nothing until you have consulted your wife.',\n",
       " '\" \"Consulted my wife?\" snapped Kerry. \"What the devil do you mean?\" \"I mean that any steps you may take now can only lead to disaster for many, and in your own case to great sorrow.\" Kerry took a step forward, two steps, then paused.',\n",
       " ' He was considering certain words which the Eurasian had spoken. Without fearing the man in the physical sense, he was not fool enough to underestimate his potentialities for evil and his power to strike darkly.',\n",
       " ' \"Act as you please,\" added Zani Chada, speaking even more softly. \"But I have not advised lightly. I will receive you, Chief Inspector, at any hour of the night you care to return. By to–morrow, if you wish, you may be independent of everybody.',\n",
       " '\" Kerry clenched his fists. \"And great sorrow may be spared to others,\" concluded the Eurasian. Kerry\\'s teeth snapped together audibly; then, putting on his hat, he turned and walked straight to the door.',\n",
       " 'V: Dan Kerry, Junior Dan Kerry, junior, was humorously like his father, except that he was larger–boned and promised to grow into a much bigger man. His hair was uncompromisingly red, and grew in such irregular fashion that the comb was not made which could subdue it.',\n",
       " ' He had the wide–open, fighting blue eyes of the Chief Inspector, and when he smiled the presence of two broken teeth lent him a very pugilistic appearance. On his advent at the school of which he was now one of the most popular members, he had promptly been christened \"Carrots.',\n",
       " '\" To this nickname young Kerry had always taken exception, and he proceeded to display his prejudice on the first day of his arrival with such force and determination that the sobriquet had been withdrawn by tacit consent of every member of the form who hitherto had favoured it.',\n",
       " ' \"I\\'ll take you all on,\" the new arrival had declared amidst a silence of stupefaction, \"starting with you\"—pointing to the biggest boy. \"If we don\\'t finish to–day, I\\'ll begin again to–morrow.\" The sheer impudence of the thing had astounded everybody.',\n",
       " \" Young Kerry's treatment of his leading persecutor had produced a salutary change of opinion. Of such kidney was Daniel Kerry, junior; and when, some hours after his father's departure on the night of the murder in the fog, the 'phone bell rang, it was Dan junior, and not his mother, who answered the call.\",\n",
       " ' \"Hallo!\" said a voice. \"Is that Chief Inspector Kerry\\'s house?\" \"Yes,\" replied Dan. \"It has begun to rain in town,\" the voice continued, \"Is that the Chief Inspector\\'s son speaking?\" \"Yes, I\\'m Daniel Kerry.',\n",
       " '\" \"Well, my boy, you know the way to New Scotland Yard?\" \"Rather.\" \"He says will you bring his overall? Do you know where to find it?\" \"Yes, yes!\" cried Dan excitedly, delighted to be thus made a party to his father\\'s activities.',\n",
       " ' \"Well, get it. Jump on a tram at the Town Hall and bring the overall along here. Your mother will not object, will she?\" \"Of course not,\" cried Dan. \"I\\'ll tell her. Am I to start now?\" \"Yes, right away.',\n",
       " '\" Mrs. Kerry was sewing by the fire in the dining room when her son came in with the news, his blue eyes sparkling excitedly. She nodded her head slowly. \"Ye\\'ll want ye\\'r Burberry and ye\\'r thick boots,\" she declared, \"a muffler, too, and ye\\'r oldest cap.',\n",
       " ' I think it\\'s madness for ye to go out on such a night, but―\" \"Father said I could,\" protested the boy. \"He says so, and ye shall go, but I think it madness a\\' the same.\" However, some ten minutes later young Kerry set out, keenly resenting the woollen muffler which he had been compelled to wear, and secretly determined to remove it before mounting the tram.',\n",
       " \" Across one arm he carried the glistening overall which was the Chief Inspector's constant companion on wet nights abroad. The fog had turned denser, and ten paces from the door of the house took him out of sight of the light streaming from the hallway.\",\n",
       " \" Mary Kerry well knew her husband's theories about coddling boys, but even so could not entirely reconcile herself to the present expedition. However, closing the door, she returned philosophically to her sewing, reflecting that little harm could come to Dan after all, for he was strong, healthy, and intelligent.\",\n",
       " ' On went the boy through the mist, whistling merrily. Not twenty yards from the house a coupe was drawn up, and by the light of one of its lamps a man was consulting a piece of paper on which, presumably, an address was written; for, as the boy approached, the man turned, his collar pulled up about his face, his hat pulled down.',\n",
       " ' \"Hallo!\" he called. \"Can you please tell me something?\" He spoke with a curious accent, unfamiliar to the boy. \"A foreigner of some kind,\" young Kerry determined. \"What is it?\" he asked, pausing. \"Will you please read and tell me if I am near this place?\" the man continued, holding up the paper which he had been scrutinizing.',\n",
       " ' Dan stepped forward and bent over it. He could not make out the writing, and bent yet more, holding it nearer to the lamp. At which moment some second person neatly pinioned him from behind, a scarf was whipped about his head, and, kicking furiously but otherwise helpless, he felt himself lifted and placed inside the car.',\n",
       " \" The muffler had been thrown in such fashion about his face as to leave one eye partly free, and as he was lifted he had a momentary glimpse of his captors. With a thrill of real, sickly terror he realized that he was in the hands of Chinamen! Perhaps telepathically this spasm of fear was conveyed to his father, for it was at about this time that the latter was interviewing Zani Chada, and at about this time that Kerry recognized, underlying the other's words, at once an ill–concealed suspense and a threat.\",\n",
       " \" Then, a few minutes later, had come the three strokes of the gong; and again that unreasonable dread had assailed him, perhaps because it signalized the capture of his son, news of which had been immediately telephoned to Limehouse by Zani Chada's orders.\",\n",
       " ' Certain it is that Kerry left the Eurasian\\'s house in a frame of mind which was not familiar to him. He was undecided respecting his next move. A deadly menace underlay Chada\\'s words. \"Consult your wife,\" he kept muttering to himself.',\n",
       " ' When the door was opened for him by the Chinese servant, he paused a moment before going out into the fog. There were men on duty at the back and at the front of the house. Should he risk all and raid the place? That Lady Rourke was captive here he no longer doubted.',\n",
       " ' But it was equally certain that no further harm would come to her at the hands of her captors, since she had been traced there and since Zani Chada was well aware of the fact. Of the whereabouts of Lou Chada he could not be certain.',\n",
       " ' If he was in the house, they had him. The door was closed by the Chinaman, and Kerry stood out in the darkness of the dismal, brick–walled street, feeling something as nearly akin to dejection as was possible in one of his mercurial spirit.',\n",
       " ' Something trickled upon the brim of his hat, and, raising his head, Kerry detected rain upon his upturned face. He breathed a prayer of thankfulness. This would put an end to the fog. He began to walk along by the high brick wall, but had not proceeded far before a muffled figure arose before him and the light of an electric torch was shone into his face.',\n",
       " ' \"Oh, it\\'s you, Chief Inspector!\" came the voice of the watcher. \"It is,\" rapped Kerry. \"Unless there are tunnels under this old rat–hole, I take it the men on duty can cover all the exits?\" \"All the main exits,\" was the reply.',\n",
       " ' \"But, as you say, it\\'s a strange house, and Zani Chada has a stranger reputation.\" \"Do nothing until you hear from me.\" \"Very good, Chief Inspector.\" The rain now was definitely conquering the fog, and in half the time which had been occupied by the outward journey Kerry was back again in Limehouse police station.',\n",
       " ' Unconsciously he had been hastening his pace with every stride, urged onward by an unaccountable anxiety, so that finally he almost ran into the office and up to the desk where the telephone stood. Lifting it, he called his own number and stood tapping his foot, impatiently awaiting the reply.',\n",
       " ' Presently came the voice of the operator: \"Have they answered yet?\" \"No.\" \"I will ring them again.\" Kerry\\'s anxiety became acute, almost unendurable; and when at last, after repeated attempts, no reply could be obtained from his home, he replaced the receiver and leaned for a moment on the desk, shaken with such a storm of apprehension as he had rarely known.',\n",
       " ' He turned to the inspector in charge, and: \"Let me have that envelope I left with you,\" he directed. \"And have someone \\'phone for a taxi; they are to keep on till they get one. Where is Sergeant Durham?\" \"At the mortuary.',\n",
       " '\" \"Ah!\" \"Any developments, Chief Inspector?\" \"Yes. But apart from keeping a close watch upon the house of Zani Chada you are to do nothing until you hear from me again.\" \"Very good,\" said the inspector.',\n",
       " ' \"Are you going to wait for Durham\\'s report?\" \"No. Directly the cab arrives I am going to wait for nothing.\" Indeed, he paced up and down the room like a wild beast caged, while call after call was sent to neighbouring cab ranks, for a long time without result.',\n",
       " \" What did it mean, his wife's failure to answer the telephone? It might mean that neither she nor their one servant nor Dan was in the house. And if they were not in the house at this hour of the night, where could they possibly be? This it might mean, or—something worse.\",\n",
       " ' A thousand and one possibilities, hideous, fantastic, appalling, flashed through his mind. He was beginning to learn what Zani Chada had meant when he had said: \"I have followed your career with interest.',\n",
       " '\" At last a taxi was found, and the man instructed over the \\'phone to proceed immediately to Limehouse station. He seemed so long in coming that when at last the cab was heard to pause outside, Kerry could not trust himself to speak to the driver, but directed a sergeant to give him the address.',\n",
       " ' He entered silently and closed the door. A steady drizzle of rain was falling. It had already dispersed the fog, so that he might hope with luck to be home within the hour. As a matter of fact, the man performed the journey in excellent time, but it seemed to his passenger that he could have walked quicker, such was the gnawing anxiety within him and the fear which prompted him to long for wings.',\n",
       " ' Instructing the cabman to wait, Kerry unlocked the front door and entered. He had noted a light in the dining room window, and entering, he found his wife awaiting him there. She rose as he entered, with horror in her comely face.',\n",
       " ' \"Dan!\" she whispered. \"Dan! where is ye\\'r mackintosh?\" \"I didn\\'t take it,\" he replied, endeavouring to tell himself that his apprehensions had been groundless. \"But how was it that you did not answer the telephone?\" \"What do ye mean, Dan?\" Mary Kerry stared, her eyes growing wider and wider.',\n",
       " ' \"The boy answered, Dan. He set out wi\\' ye\\'r mackintosh full an hour and a half since.\" \"What!\" The truth leaped out at Kerry like an enemy out of ambush. \"Who sent that message?\" \"Someone frae the Yard, to tell the boy to bring ye\\'r mackintosh alone at once.',\n",
       " ' Dan! Dan―—\" She advanced, hands outstretched, quivering, but Kerry had leaped out into the narrow hallway. He raised the telephone receiver, listened for a moment, and then jerked it back upon the hook.',\n",
       " ' \"Dead line!\" he muttered. \"Someone has been at work with a wire–cutter outside the house!\" His wife came out to where he stood, and, clenching his teeth very grimly, he took her in his arms. She was shaking as if palsied.',\n",
       " ' \"Mary dear,\" he said, \"pray with all your might that I am given strength to do my duty.\" She looked at him with haggard, tearless eyes. \"Tell me the truth: ha\\' they got my boy?\" His fingers tightened on her shoulders.',\n",
       " ' \"Don\\'t worry,\" he said, \"and don\\'t ask me to stay to explain. When I come back I\\'ll have Dan with me!\" He trusted himself no further, but, clapping his hat on his head, walked out to the waiting cab. \"Back to Limehouse police station,\" he directed rapidly.',\n",
       " ' \"Lor lumme!\" muttered the taximan. \"Where are you goin\\' to after that, guv\\'nor? It\\'s a bit off the map.\" \"I\\'m going to hell!\" rapped Kerry, suddenly thrusting his red face very near to that of the speaker.',\n",
       " 'VI: The Knight Errant Recognizing the superior strength of his captors, young Kerry soon gave up struggling. The thrill of his first real adventure entered into his blood. He remembered that he was the son of his father, and he realized, being a quick–witted lad, that he was in the grip of enemies of his father.',\n",
       " ' The panic which had threatened him when first he had recognized that he was in the hands of Chinese, gave place to a cold rage—a heritage which in later years was to make him a dangerous man. He lay quite passively in the grasp of someone who held him fast, and learned, by breathing quietly, that the presence of the muffler about his nose and mouth did not greatly inconvenience him.',\n",
       " ' There was some desultory conversation between the two men in the car, but it was carried on in an odd, sibilant language which the boy did not understand, but which he divined to be Chinese. He thought how every other boy in the school would envy him, and the thought was stimulating, nerving.',\n",
       " ' On the very first day of his holidays he was become the central figure of a Chinatown drama. The last traces of fear fled. His position was uncomfortable and his limbs were cramped, but he resigned himself, with something almost like gladness, and began to look forward to that which lay ahead with a zest and a will to be no passive instrument which might have surprised his captors could they have read the mind of their captive.',\n",
       " ' The journey seemed almost interminable, but young Kerry suffered it in stoical silence until the car stopped and he was lifted and carried down stone steps into some damp, earthy–smelling place. Some distance was traversed, and then many flights of stairs were mounted, some bare but others carpeted.',\n",
       " ' Finally he was deposited in a chair, and as he raised his hand to the scarf, which toward the end of the journey had been bound more tightly about his head so as to prevent him from seeing at all, he heard a door closed and locked.',\n",
       " ' The scarf was quickly removed. And Dan found himself in a low–ceilinged attic having a sloping roof and one shuttered window. A shadeless electric lamp hung from the ceiling. Excepting the cane–seated chair in which he had been deposited and a certain amount of nondescript lumber, the attic was unfurnished.',\n",
       " ' Dan rapidly considered what his father would have done in the circumstances. \"Make sure that the door is locked,\" he muttered. He tried it, and it was locked beyond any shadow of doubt. \"The window.\" Shutters covered it, and these were fastened with a padlock.',\n",
       " ' He considered this padlock attentively; then, drawing from his pocket one of those wonderful knives which are really miniature tool–chests, he raised from a grove the screw–driver which formed part of its equipment, and with neatness and dispatch unscrewed the staple to which the padlock was attached! A moment later he had opened the shutters and was looking out into the drizzle of the night.',\n",
       " ' The room in which he was confined was on the third floor of a dingy, brick–built house; a portion of some other building faced him; down below was a stone–paved courtyard. To the left stood a high wall, and beyond it he obtained a glimpse of other dingy buildings.',\n",
       " ' One lighted window was visible—a square window in the opposite building, from which amber light shone out. Somewhere in the street beyond was a standard lamp. He could detect the halo which it cast into the misty rain.',\n",
       " ' The glass was very dirty, and young Kerry raised the sash, admitting a draught of damp, cold air into the room. He craned out, looking about him eagerly. A rainwater–pipe was within reach of his hand on the right of the window and, leaning out still farther, young Kerry saw that it passed beside two other, larger, windows on the floor beneath him.',\n",
       " ' Neither of these showed any light. Dizzy heights have no terror for healthy youth. The brackets supporting the rain–pipe were a sufficient staircase for the agile Dan, a more slippery prisoner than the famous Baron Trenck; and, discarding his muffler and his Burberry, he climbed out upon the sill and felt with his thick–soled boots for the first of these footholds.',\n",
       " ' Clutching the ledge, he lowered himself and felt for the next. Then came the moment when he must trust all his weight to the pipe. Clenching his teeth, he risked it, felt for and found the third angle, and then, still clutching the pipe, stood for a moment upon the ledge of the window immediately beneath him.',\n",
       " ' He was curious respecting the lighted window of the neighbouring house; and, twisting about, he bent, peering across—and saw a sight which arrested his progress. The room within was furnished in a way which made him gasp with astonishment.',\n",
       " \" It was like an Eastern picture, he thought. Her golden hair dishevelled and her hands alternately clenching and unclenching, a woman whom he considered to be most wonderfully dressed was pacing wildly up and down, a look of such horror upon her pale face that Dan's heart seemed to stop beating for a moment! Here was real trouble of a sort which appealed to all the chivalry in the boy's nature.\",\n",
       " ' He considered the window, which was glazed with amber–coloured glass, observed that it was sufficiently open to enable him to slip the fastening and open it entirely could he but reach it. And—yes!—there was a rain–pipe! Climbing down to the yard, he looked quickly about him, ran across, and climbed up to the lighted window.',\n",
       " ' A moment later he had pushed it widely open. He was greeted by a stifled cry, but, cautiously transferring his weight from the friendly pipe to the ledge, he got astride of it, one foot in the room. Then, by exercise of a monkey–like agility, he wriggled his head and shoulders within.',\n",
       " ' \"It\\'s all right,\" he said softly and reassuringly; \"I\\'m Dan Kerry, son of Chief Inspector Kerry. Can I be of any assistance?\" Her hands clasped convulsively together, the woman stood looking up at him.',\n",
       " ' \"Oh, thank God!\" said the captive. \"But what are you going to do? Can you get me out?\" \"Don\\'t worry,\" replied Dan confidently. \"Father and I can manage it all right!\" He performed a singular contortion, as a result of which his other leg and foot appeared inside the window.',\n",
       " ' Then, twisting around, he lowered himself and dropped triumphantly upon a cushioned divan. At that moment he would have faced a cage full of man–eating tigers. The spirit of adventure had him in its grip.',\n",
       " ' He stood up, breathing rapidly, his crop of red hair more dishevelled than usual. Then, before he could stir or utter any protest, the golden–haired princess whom he had come to rescue stooped, threw her arms around his neck, and kissed him.',\n",
       " ' \"You darling, brave boy!\" she said. \"I think you have saved me from madness.\" Young Kerry, more flushed than ever, extricated himself, and: \"You\\'re not out of the mess yet,\" he protested. \"The only difference is that I\\'m in it with you!\" \"But where is your father?\" \"I\\'m looking for him.',\n",
       " '\" \"What!\" \"Oh! he\\'s about somewhere,\" Dan assured her confidently. \"But, but―\" She was gazing at him wide–eyed, \"Didn\\'t he send you here?\" \"You bet he didn\\'t,\" returned young Kerry. \"I came here on my own accord, and when I go you\\'re coming with me.',\n",
       " ' I can\\'t make out how you got here, anyway. Do you know whose house this is?\" \"Oh, I do, I do!\" \"Whose?\" \"It belongs to a man called Chada.\" \"Chada? Never heard of him. But I mean, what part of London is it in?\" \"Whatever do you mean? It is in Limehouse, I believe.',\n",
       " ' I don\\'t understand. You came here.\" \"I didn\\'t,\" said young Kerry cheerfully; \"I was fetched!\" \"By your father?\" \"Not on your life. By a couple of Chinks! I\\'ll tell you something.\" He raised his twinkling blue eyes.',\n",
       " ' \"We are properly up against it. I suppose you couldn\\'t climb down a rain–pipe?\".',\n",
       " 'VII: Retribution It was that dark, still, depressing hour of the night, when all life is at its lowest ebb. In the low, strangely perfumed room of books Zani Chada sat before his table, his yellow hands clutching the knobs on his chair arms, his long, inscrutable eyes staring unseeingly before him.',\n",
       " ' Came a disturbance and the sound of voices, and Lou Chada, his son, stood at the doorway. He still wore his evening clothes, but he no longer looked smart. His glossy black hair was dishevelled, and his handsome, olive face bore a hunted look.',\n",
       " ' Panic was betoken by twitching mouth and fear–bright eyes. He stopped, glaring at his father, and: \"Why are you not gone?\" asked the latter sternly. \"Do you wish to wreck me as well as yourself?\" \"The police have posted a man opposite Kwee\\'s house.',\n",
       " ' I cannot get out that way.\" \"There was no one there when the boy was brought in.\" \"No, but there is now. Father!\" He took a step forward. \"I\\'m trapped. They sha\\'n\\'t take me. You won\\'t let them take me?\" Zani Chada stirred not a muscle, but: \"To–night,\" he said, \"your mad passion has brought ruin to both of us.',\n",
       " ' For the sake of a golden doll who is not worth the price of the jewels she wears, you have placed yourself within reach of the hangman.\" \"I was mad, I was mad,\" groaned the other. \"But I, who was sane, am involved in the consequences,\" retorted his father.',\n",
       " ' \"He will be silent at the price of the boy\\'s life.\" \"He may be,\" returned Zani Chada. \"I hate him, but he is a man. Had you escaped, he might have consented to be silent. Once you are arrested, nothing would silence him.',\n",
       " '\" \"If the case is tried it will ruin Pat\\'s reputation.\" \"What a pity!\" said Zani Chada. In some distant part of the house a gong was struck three times. \"Go,\" commanded his father. \"Remain at Kwee\\'s house until I send for you.',\n",
       " ' Let Ah Fang go to the room above and see that the woman is silent. An outcry would ruin our last chance.\" Lou Chada raised his hands, brushing the hair back from his wet forehead, then, staring haggardly at his father, turned and ran from the room.',\n",
       " ' A minute later Kerry was ushered in by the Chinese servant. The savage face was set like a mask. Without removing his hat, he strode across to the table and bent down so that fierce, wide–open blue eyes stared closely into long, half–closed black ones.',\n",
       " ' \"I\\'ve got one thing to say,\" explained Kerry huskily. \"Whatever the hangman may do to your slimy son, and whatever happens to the little blonde fool he kidnapped, if you\\'ve laid a hand on my kid I\\'ll kick you to death, if I follow you round the world to do it.',\n",
       " '\" Zani Chada made no reply, but his knuckles gleamed, so tightly did he clutch the knobs on the chair arms. Kerry\\'s savagery would have awed any man, even though he had supposed it to be the idle threat of a passionate man.',\n",
       " ' But Zani Chada knew all men, and he knew this one. When Daniel Kerry declared that in given circumstances he would kick Zani Chada to death, he did not mean that he would shoot him, strangle him, or even beat him with his fists; he meant precisely what he said—that he would kick him to death—and Zani Chada knew it.',\n",
       " ' Thus there were some moments of tense silence during which the savage face of the Chief Inspector drew even closer to the gaunt, yellow face of the Eurasian. Finally: \"Listen only for one moment,\" said Zani Chada.',\n",
       " ' His voice had lost its guttural intonation. He spoke softly, sibilantly. \"I, too, am a father―—\" \"Don\\'t mince words!\" shouted Kerry. \"You\\'ve kidnapped my boy. If I have to tear your house down brick by brick I\\'ll find him.',\n",
       " ' And if you\\'ve hurt one hair of his head—you know what to expect!\" He quivered. The effort of suppression which he had imposed upon himself was frightful to witness. Zani Chada, student of men, knew that in despite of his own physical strength and of the hidden resources at his beck, he stood nearer to primitive retribution than he had ever done.',\n",
       " ' Yet: \"I understand,\" he continued. \"But you do not understand. Your boy is not in this house. Oh! violence cannot avail! It can only make his loss irreparable.\" Kerry, nostrils distended, eyes glaring madly, bent over him.',\n",
       " ' \"Your scallywag of a son,\" he said hoarsely, \"has gone one step too far. His adventures have twice before ended in murder—and you have covered him. This time you can\\'t do it. I\\'m not to be bought. We\\'ve stood for the Far East in London long enough.',\n",
       " \" Your cub hangs this time. Get me? There'll be no bargaining. The woman's reputation won't stop me. My kid's danger won't stop me. But if you try to use him as a lever I'll boot you to your stinking yellow paradise and they'll check you in as pulp.\",\n",
       " '\" \"You speak of three deaths,\" murmured Zani Chada. Kerry clenched his teeth so tightly that his maxillary muscles protruded to an abnormal degree. He thrust his clenched fists into his coat pockets. \"We all follow our vocations in life,\" resumed the Eurasian, \"to the best of our abilities.',\n",
       " ' But is professional kudos not too dearly bought at the price of a loved one lost for ever? A far better bargain would be, shall we say, ten thousand pounds, as the price of a silk handkerchief―—\" Kerry\\'s fierce blue eyes closed for a fraction of a second.',\n",
       " \" Yet, in that fraction of a second, he had visualized some of the things which ten thousand pounds—a sum he could never hope to possess—would buy. He had seen his home, as he would have it—and he had seen Dan there, safe and happy at his mother's side.\",\n",
       " ' Was he entitled to disregard the happiness of his wife, the life of his boy, the honourable name of Sir Noel Rourke, because an outcast like Peters had come to a fitting end—because a treacherous Malay and a renegade Chinaman had, earlier, gone the same way, sped, as he suspected, by the same hand? \"My resources are unusual,\" added Chada, speaking almost in a whisper.',\n",
       " ' \"I have cash to this amount in my safe―—\" So far he had proceeded when he was interrupted; and the cause of the interruption was this: A few moments earlier another dramatic encounter had taken place in a distant part of the house.',\n",
       " ' Kerry Junior, having scientifically tested all the possible modes of egress from the room in which Lady Pat was confined, had long ago desisted, and had exhausted his ingenuity in plans which discussion had proved to be useless.',\n",
       " ' In spite of the novelty and the danger of his situation, nature was urging her laws. He was growing sleepy. The crowning tragedy had been the discovery that he could not regain the small, square window set high in the wall from which he had dropped into this luxurious prison.',\n",
       " \" Now, as the two sat side by side upon a cushioned divan, the woman's arm about the boy's shoulders, they were startled to hear, in the depths of the house, three notes of a gong. Young Kerry's sleepiness departed.\",\n",
       " ' He leapt to his feet as though electrified. \"What was that?\" There was something horrifying in those gong notes in the stillness of the night. Lady Pat\\'s beautiful eyes grew glassy with fear. \"I don\\'t know,\" replied Dan.',\n",
       " ' \"It seemed to come from below.\" He ran to the door, drew the curtain aside, and pressed his ear against one of the panels, listening intently. As he did so, his attitude grew tense, his expression changed, then: \"We\\'re saved!\" he cried, turning a radiant face to the woman.',\n",
       " ' \"I heard my father\\'s voice!\" \"Oh, are you sure, are you sure?\" \"Absolutely sure!\" He bent to press his ear to the panel again, when a stifled cry from his companion brought him swiftly to his feet. The second door in the room had opened silently, and a small Chinaman, who carried himself with a stoop, had entered, and now, a menacing expression upon his face, was quickly approaching the boy.',\n",
       " \" What he had meant to do for ever remained in doubt, for young Kerry, knowing his father to be in the house and seeing an open door before him, took matters into his own hands. At the moment that the silent Chinaman was about to throw his arms about him, the pride of the junior school registered a most surprising left accurately on the point of Ah Fang's jaw, following it up by a wilful transgression of Queensberry rules in the form of a stomach punch which temporarily decided the issue.\",\n",
       " ' Then: \"Quick! quick!\" he cried breathlessly, grasping Lady Pat\\'s hand. \"This is where we run!\" In such fashion was Zani Chada interrupted, the interruption taking the form of a sudden, shrill outcry: \"Dad! dad! Where are you, dad?\" Kerry spun about as a man galvanized.',\n",
       " ' His face became transfigured. \"This way, Dan!\" he cried. \"This way, boy!\" Came a clatter of hurrying feet, and into the low, perfumed room burst Dan Kerry, junior, tightly clasping the hand of a pale–faced, dishevelled woman in evening dress.',\n",
       " ' It was Lady Rourke; and although she seemed to be in a nearly fainting condition, Dan dragged her, half running, into the room. Kerry gave one glance at the pair, then, instantly, he turned to face Zani Chada.',\n",
       " ' The latter, like a man of stone, sat in his carved chair, eyes nearly closed. The Chief Inspector whipped out a whistle and raised it to his lips. He blew three blasts upon it. From one—two—three—four points around the house the signal was answered.',\n",
       " ' Zani Chada fully opened his long, basilisk eyes. \"You win, Chief Inspector,\" he said. \"But much may be done by clever counsel. If all fails―—\" \"Well?\" rapped Kerry fiercely, at the same time throwing his arm around the boy.',\n",
       " ' \"I may continue to take an interest in your affairs.\" A tremendous uproar arose, within and without the house. The police were raiding the place. Lady Rourke sank down, slowly, almost at the Eurasian\\'s feet.',\n",
       " ' But Chief Inspector Kerry experienced an unfamiliar chill as his uncompromising stare met the cold hatred which blazed out of the black eyes, narrowed, now, and serpentine, of Zani Chada..',\n",
       " 'The Pigtail of Hi Wing HoI: How I Obtained It Leaving the dock gates behind me I tramped through the steady drizzle, going parallel with the river and making for the Chinese quarter. The hour was about half–past eleven on one of those September nights when, in such a locality as this, a stifling quality seems to enter the atmosphere, rendering it all but unbreathable.',\n",
       " ' A mist floated over the river, and it was difficult to say if the rain was still falling, indeed, or if the ample moisture upon my garments was traceable only to the fog. Sounds were muffled, lights dimmed, and the frequent hooting of sirens from the river added another touch of weirdness to the scene.',\n",
       " ' Even when the peculiar duties of my friend, Paul Harley, called him away from England, the lure of this miniature Orient which I had first explored under his guidance, often called me from my chambers.',\n",
       " ' In the house with the two doors in Wade Street, Limehouse, I would discard the armour of respectability, and, dressed in a manner unlikely to provoke comment in dockland, would haunt those dreary ways sometimes from midnight until close upon dawn.',\n",
       " \" Yet, well as I knew the district and the strange and often dangerous creatures lurking in its many burrows, I experienced a chill partly physical and partly of apprehension to–night; indeed, strange though it may sound, I hastened my footsteps in order the sooner to reach the low den for which I was bound—Malay Jack's—a spot marked plainly on the crimes–map and which few respectable travellers would have regarded as a haven of refuge.\",\n",
       " ' But the chill of the adjacent river, and some quality of utter desolation which seemed to emanate from the deserted wharves and ramshackle buildings about me, were driving me thither now; for I knew that human companionship, of a sort, and a glass of good liquor—from a store which the Customs would have been happy to locate—awaited me there.',\n",
       " ' I might chance, too, upon Durham or Wessex, of New Scotland Yard, both good friends of mine, or even upon the Terror of Chinatown, Chief Inspector Kerry, a man for whom I had an esteem which none of his ungracious manners could diminish.',\n",
       " ' I was just about to turn to the right into a narrow and nameless alley, lying at right angles to the Thames, when I pulled up sharply, clenching my fists and listening. A confused and continuous sound, not unlike that which might be occasioned by several large and savage hounds at close grips, was proceeding out of the darkness ahead of me; a worrying, growling, and scuffling which presently I identified as human, although in fact it was animal enough.',\n",
       " ' A moment I hesitated, then, distinguishing among the sounds of conflict an unmistakable, though subdued, cry for help, I leaped forward and found myself in the midst of the melee. This was taking place in the lee of a high, dilapidated brick wall.',\n",
       " ' A lamp in a sort of iron bracket spluttered dimly above on the right, but the scene of the conflict lay in densest shadow, so that the figures were indistinguishable. \"Help! By Gawd! they\\'re strangling me―—\" From almost at my feet the cry arose and was drowned in Chinese chattering.',\n",
       " ' But guided by it I now managed to make out that the struggle in progress waged between a burly English sailorman and two lithe Chinese. The yellow men seemed to have gained the advantage and my course was clear.',\n",
       " ' A straight right on the jaw of the Chinaman who was engaged in endeavouring to throttle the victim laid him prone in the dirty roadway. His companion, who was holding the wrist of the recumbent man, sprang upright as though propelled by a spring.',\n",
       " ' I struck out at him savagely. He uttered a shrill scream not unlike that of a stricken hare, and fled so rapidly that he seemed to melt in the mist. \"Gawd bless you, mate!\" came chokingly from the ground—and the rescued man, extricating himself from beneath the body of his stunned assailant, rose unsteadily to his feet and lurched toward me.',\n",
       " ' As I had surmised, he was a sailor, wearing a rough, blue–serge jacket and having his greasy trousers thrust into heavy seaboots—by which I judged that he was but newly come ashore. He stooped and picked up his cap.',\n",
       " ' It was covered in mud, as were the rest of his garments, but he brushed it with his sleeve as though it had been but slightly soiled and clapped it on his head. He grasped my hand in a grip of iron, peering into my face, and his breath was eloquent.',\n",
       " ' \"I\\'d had one or two, mate,\" he confided huskily (the confession was unnecessary). \"It was them two in the Blue Anchor as did it; if I \\'adn\\'t \\'ad them last two, I could \\'ave broke up them Chinks with one \\'and tied behind me.',\n",
       " '\" \"That\\'s all right,\" I said hastily, \"but what are we going to do about this Chink here?\" I added, endeavouring at the same time to extricate my hand from the vise–like grip in which he persistently held it.',\n",
       " ' \"He hit the tiles pretty heavy when he went down.\" As if to settle my doubts, the recumbent figure suddenly arose and without a word fled into the darkness and was gone like a phantom. My new friend made no attempt to follow, but: \"You can\\'t kill a bloody Chink,\" he confided, still clutching my hand; \"it ain\\'t \\'umanly possible.',\n",
       " ' It\\'s easier to kill a cat. Come along o\\' me and \\'ave one; then I\\'ll tell you somethink. I\\'ll put you on somethink, I will.\" With surprising steadiness of gait, considering the liquid cargo he had aboard, the man, releasing my hand and now seizing me firmly by the arm, confidently led me by divers narrow ways, which I knew, to a little beerhouse frequented by persons of his class.',\n",
       " ' My own attire was such as to excite no suspicion in these surroundings, and although I considered that my acquaintance had imbibed more than enough for one night, I let him have his own way in order that I might learn the story which he seemed disposed to confide in me.',\n",
       " ' Settled in the corner of the beerhouse—which chanced to be nearly empty—with portentous pewters before us, the conversation was opened by my new friend: \"I\\'ve been paid off from the Jupiter—Samuelson\\'s Planet Line,\" he explained.',\n",
       " ' \"What I am is a fireman.\" \"She was from Singapore to London?\" I asked. \"She was,\" he replied, \"and it was at Suez it \\'appened—at Suez.\" I did not interrupt him. \"I was ashore at Suez—we all was, owin\\' to a \\'itch with the canal company—a matter of money, I may say.',\n",
       " ' They make yer pay before they\\'ll take yer through. Do you know that?\" I nodded. \"Suez is a place,\" he continued, \"where they don\\'t sell whisky, only poison. Was you ever at Suez?\" Again I nodded, being most anxious to avoid diverting the current of my friend\\'s thoughts.',\n",
       " ' \"Well, then,\" he continued, \"you know Greek Jimmy\\'s—and that\\'s where I\\'d been.\" I did not know Greek Jimmy\\'s, but I thought it unnecessary to mention the fact. \"It was just about this time on a steamin\\' \\'ot night as I come out of Jimmy\\'s and started for the ship.',\n",
       " \" I was walkin' along the Waghorn Quay, same as I might be walkin' along to–night, all by myself—bit of a list to port but nothing much—full o' joy an' happiness, 'appy an' free—'appy an' free. Just like you might have noticed to–night, I noticed a knot of Chinks scrappin' on the ground all amongst the dust right in front of me.\",\n",
       " \" I rammed in, windmillin' all round and knocking 'em down like skittles. Seemed to me there was about ten of 'em, but allowin' for Jimmy's whisky, maybe there wasn't more than three. Anyway, they all shifted and left me standin' there in the empty street with this 'ere in my 'and.\",\n",
       " '\" At that, without more ado, he thrust his hand deep into some concealed pocket and jerked out a Chinese pigtail, which had been severed, apparently some three inches from the scalp, by a clean cut. My acquaintance, with somewhat bleared eyes glistening in appreciation of his own dramatic skill—for I could not conceal my surprise—dangled it before me triumphantly.',\n",
       " ' \"Which of \\'em it belong to,\" he continued, thrusting it into another pocket and drumming loudly on the counter for more beer, \"I can\\'t say, \\'cos I don\\'t know. But that ain\\'t all.\" The tankards being refilled and my friend having sampled the contents of his own: \"That ain\\'t all,\" he continued.',\n",
       " ' \"I thought I\\'d keep it as a sort of relic, like. What \\'appened? I\\'ll tell you. Amongst the crew there\\'s three Chinks—see? We ain\\'t through the canal before one of \\'em, a new one to me—Li Ping is his name—offers me five bob for the pigtail, which he sees me looking at one mornin\\'.',\n",
       " ' I give him a punch on the nose an\\' \\'e don\\'t renew the offer: but that night (we\\'re layin\\' at Port Said) \\'e tries to pinch it!

To–night\"—he extended his right arm forensically—\"a deppitation of Chinks waits on me at the dock gates; they explains as from a patriotic point of view they feels it to be their dooty to buy that pigtail off of me, and they bids a quid, a bar of gold—a Jimmy o\\' Goblin!\" He snapped his fingers contemptuously and emptied his pewter.',\n",
       " ' A sense of what was coming began to dawn on me. That the \"hold–up\" near the riverside formed part of the scheme was possible, and, reflecting on my rough treatment of the two Chinamen, I chuckled inwardly.',\n",
       " ' Possibly, however, the scheme had germinated in my acquaintance\\'s mind merely as a result of an otherwise common assault, of a kind not unusual in these parts, but, whether elaborate or comparatively simple, that the story of the pigtail was a \"plant\" designed to reach my pocket, seemed a reasonable hypothesis.',\n",
       " ' \"I told him to go to China,\" concluded the object of my suspicion, again rapping upon the counter, \"and you see what come of it. All I got to say is this: If they\\'re so bloody patriotic, I says one thing: I ain\\'t the man to stand in their way.',\n",
       " ' You done me a good turn to–night, mate; I\\'m doing you one. \\'Ere\\'s the bloody pigtail, \\'ere\\'s my empty mug. Fill the mug and the pigtail\\'s yours. It\\'s good for a quid at the dock gates any day!\" My suspicions vanished; my interest arose to boiling point.',\n",
       " \" I refilled my acquaintance's mug, pressed a sovereign upon him (in honesty I must confess that he was loath to take it), and departed with the pigtail coiled neatly in an inner pocket of my jacket. I entered the house in Wade Street by the side door, and half an hour later let myself out by the front door, having cast off my dockland disguise.\",\n",
       " \"II: How I Lost It It was not until the following evening that I found leisure to examine my strange acquisition, for affairs of more immediate importance engrossed my attention. But at about ten o'clock I seated myself at my table, lighted the lamp, and taking out the pigtail from the table drawer, placed it on the blotting–pad and began to examine it with the greatest curiosity, for few Chinese affect the pigtail nowadays.\",\n",
       " ' I had scarcely commenced my examination, however, when it was dramatically interrupted. The door bell commenced to ring jerkily. I stood up, and as I did so the ringing ceased and in its place came a muffled beating on the door.',\n",
       " ' I hurried into the passage as the bell commenced ringing again, and I had almost reached the door when once more the ringing ceased; but now I could hear a woman\\'s voice, low but agitated: \"Open the door! Oh, for God\\'s sake be quick!\" Completely mystified, and not a little alarmed, I threw open the door, and in there staggered a woman heavily veiled, so that I could see little of her features, but by the lines of her figure I judged her to be young.',\n",
       " ' Uttering a sort of moan of terror she herself closed the door, and stood with her back to it, watching me through the thick veil, while her breast rose and fell tumultuously. \"Thank God there was someone at home!\" she gasped.',\n",
       " ' I think I may say with justice that I had never been so surprised in my life; every particular of the incident marked it as unique—set it apart from the episodes of everyday life. \"Madam,\" I began doubtfully, \"you seem to be much alarmed at something, and if I can be of any assistance to you―—\" \"You have saved my life!\" she whispered, and pressed one hand to her bosom.',\n",
       " ' \"In a moment I will explain.\" \"Won\\'t you rest a little after your evidently alarming experience?\" I suggested. My strange visitor nodded, without speaking, and I conducted her to the study which I had just left, and placed the most comfortable arm–chair close beside the table so that as I sat I might study this woman who so strangely had burst in upon me.',\n",
       " ' I even tilted the shaded lamp, artlessly, a trick I had learned from Harley, in order that the light might fall upon her face. She may have detected this device; I know not; but as if in answer to its challenge, she raised her gloved hands and unfastened the heavy veil which had concealed her features.',\n",
       " ' Thereupon I found myself looking into a pair of lustrous black eyes whose almond shape was that of the Orient; I found myself looking at a woman who, since she was evidently a Jewess, was probably no older than eighteen or nineteen, but whose beauty was ripely voluptuous, who might fittingly have posed for Salome, who, despite her modern fashionable garments, at once suggested to my mind the wanton beauty of the daughter of Herodias.',\n",
       " ' I stared at her silently for a time, and presently her full lips parted in a slow smile. My ideas were diverted into another channel. \"You have yet to tell me what alarmed you,\" I said in a low voice, but as courteously as possible, \"and if I can be of any assistance in the matter.',\n",
       " '\" My visitor seemed to recollect her fright—or the necessity for simulation. The pupils of her fine eyes seemed to grow larger and darker; she pressed her white teeth into her lower lips, and resting her hands upon the table leaned toward me.',\n",
       " ' \"I am a stranger to London,\" she began, now exhibiting a certain diffidence, \"and to–night I was looking for the chambers of Mr. Raphael Philips of Figtree Court.\" \"This is Figtree Court,\" I said, \"but I know of no Mr.',\n",
       " ' Raphael Philips who has chambers here.\" The black eyes met mine despairingly. \"But I am positive of the address!\" protested my beautiful but strange caller—from her left glove she drew out a scrap of paper, \"here it is.',\n",
       " '\" I glanced at the fragment, upon which, in a woman\\'s hand the words were pencilled: \"Mr. Raphael Philips, 36–b Figtree Court, London.\" I stared at my visitor, deeply mystified. \"These chambers are 36–b!\" I said.',\n",
       " ' \"But I am not Raphael Philips, nor have I ever heard of him. My name is Malcolm Knox. There is evidently some mistake, but\"—returning the slip of paper—\"pardon me if I remind you, I have yet to learn the cause of your alarm.',\n",
       " '\" \"I was followed across the court and up the stairs.\" \"Followed! By whom?\" \"By a dreadful–looking man, chattering in some tongue I did not understand!\" My amazement was momentarily growing greater. \"What kind of a man?\" I demanded rather abruptly.',\n",
       " ' \"A yellow–faced man—remember I could only just distinguish him in the darkness on the stairway, and see little more of him than his eyes at that, and his ugly gleaming teeth—oh! it was horrible!\" \"You astound me,\" I said; \"the thing is utterly incomprehensible.',\n",
       " '\" I switched off the light of the lamp. \"I\\'ll see if there\\'s any sign of him in the court below.\" \"Oh, don\\'t leave me! For heaven\\'s sake don\\'t leave me alone!\" She clutched my arm in the darkness. \"Have no fear; I merely propose to look out from this window.',\n",
       " '\" Suiting the action to the word, I peered down into the court below. It was quite deserted. The night was a very dark one, and there were many patches of shadow in which a man might have lain concealed.',\n",
       " ' \"I can see no one,\" I said, speaking as confidently as possible, and relighting the lamp, \"if I call a cab for you and see you safely into it, you will have nothing to fear, I think.\" \"I have a cab waiting,\" she replied, and lowering the veil she stood up to go.',\n",
       " ' \"Kindly allow me to see you to it. I am sorry you have been subjected to this annoyance, especially as you have not attained the object of your visit.\" \"Thank you so much for your kindness; there must be some mistake about the address, of course.',\n",
       " '\" She clung to my arm very tightly as we descended the stairs, and often glanced back over her shoulder affrightedly, as we crossed the court. There was not a sign of anyone about, however, and I could not make up my mind whether the story of the yellow man was a delusion or a fabrication.',\n",
       " ' I inclined to the latter theory, but the object of such a deception was more difficult to determine. Sure enough, a taxicab was waiting at the entrance to the court; and my visitor, having seated herself within, extended her hand to me, and even through the thick veil I could detect her brilliant smile.',\n",
       " ' \"Thank you so much, Mr. Knox,\" she said, \"and a thousand apologies. I am sincerely sorry to have given you all this trouble.\" The cab drove off. For a moment I stood looking after it, in a state of dreamy incertitude, then turned and slowly retraced my steps.',\n",
       " ' Reopening the door of my chambers with my key, I returned to my study and sat down at the table to endeavour to arrange the facts of what I recognized to be a really amazing episode. The adventure, trifling though it seemed, undoubtedly held some hidden significance that at present was not apparent to me.',\n",
       " ' In accordance with the excellent custom of my friend, Paul Harley, I prepared to make notes of the occurrence while the facts were still fresh in my memory. At the moment that I was about to begin, I made an astounding discovery.',\n",
       " \" Although I had been absent only a few minutes, and had locked my door behind me, the pigtail was gone! I sat quite still, listening intently. The woman's story of the yellow man on the stairs suddenly assumed a totally different aspect—a new and sinister aspect.\",\n",
       " ' Could it be that the pigtail was at the bottom of the mystery?—could it be that some murderous Chinaman who had been lurking in hiding, waiting his opportunity, had in some way gained access to my chambers during that brief absence? If so, was he gone? From the table drawer I took out a revolver, ascertained that it was fully loaded, and turning up light after light as I proceeded, conducted a room–to–room search.',\n",
       " ' It was without result; there was absolutely nothing to indicate that anyone had surreptitiously entered or departed from my chambers. I returned to the study and sat gazing at the revolver lying on the blotting–pad before me.',\n",
       " ' Perhaps my mind worked slowly, but I think that fully fifteen minutes must have passed before it dawned on me that the explanation not only of the missing pigtail but of the other incidents of the night, was simple enough.',\n",
       " ' The yellow man had been a fabrication, and my dark–eyed visitor had not been in quest of \"Raphael Philips,\" but in quest of the pigtail: and her quest had been successful! \"What a hopeless fool I am!\" I cried, and banged my fist down upon the table, \"there was no yellow man at all—there was―–\" My door bell rang.',\n",
       " ' I sprang nervously to my feet, glanced at the revolver on the table—and finally dropped it into my coat pocket ere going out and opening the door. On the landing stood a police constable and an officer in plain clothes.',\n",
       " ' \"Your name is Malcolm Knox?\" asked the constable, glancing at a note–book which he held in his hand. \"It is,\" I replied. \"You are required to come at once to Bow Street to identify a woman who was found murdered in a taxi–cab in the Strand about eleven o\\'clock to–night.',\n",
       " '\" I suppressed an exclamation of horror; I felt myself turning pale. \"But what has it to do―—\" \"The driver stated she came from your chambers, for you saw her off, and her last words to you were \\'Good night, Mr.',\n",
       " ' Knox, I am sincerely sorry to have given you all this trouble.\\' Is that correct, sir?\" The constable, who had read out the information in an official voice, now looked at me, as I stood there stupefied.',\n",
       " ' \"It is,\" I said blankly. \"I\\'ll come at once.\" It would seem that I had misjudged my unfortunate visitor: her story of the yellow man on the stair had apparently been not a fabrication, but a gruesome fact!.',\n",
       " 'III: How I Regained It My ghastly duty was performed; I had identified the dreadful thing, which less than an hour before had been a strikingly beautiful woman, as my mysterious visitor. The police were palpably disappointed at the sparsity of my knowledge respecting her.',\n",
       " ' In fact, had it not chanced that Detective Sergeant Durham was in the station, I think they would have doubted the accuracy of my story. As a man of some experience in such matters, I fully recognized its improbability, but beyond relating the circumstances leading up to my possession of the pigtail and the events which had ensued, I could do no more in the matter.',\n",
       " ' The weird relic had not been found on the dead woman, nor in the cab. Now the unsavoury business was finished, and I walked along Bow Street, racking my mind for the master–key to this mystery in which I was become enmeshed.',\n",
       " \" How I longed to rush off to Harley's rooms in Chancery Lane and to tell him the whole story! But my friend was a thousand miles away—and I had to see the thing out alone. That the pigtail was some sacred relic stolen from a Chinese temple and sought for by its fanatical custodians was a theory which persistently intruded itself.\",\n",
       " ' But I could find no place in that hypothesis for the beautiful Jewess; and that she was intimately concerned I did not doubt. A cool survey of the facts rendered it fairly evident that it was she and none other who had stolen the pigtail from my rooms.',\n",
       " ' Some third party—possibly the \"yellow man\" of whom she had spoken—had in turn stolen it from her, strangling her in the process. The police theory of the murder (and I was prepared to accept it) was that the assassin had been crouching in hiding behind or beside the cab—or even within the dark interior.',\n",
       " ' He had leaped in and attacked the woman at the moment that the taxi–man had started his engine; if already inside, the deed had proven even easier. Then, during some block in the traffic, he had slipped out unseen, leaving the body of the victim to be discovered when the cab pulled up at the hotel.',\n",
       " \" I knew of only one place in London where I might hope to obtain useful information, and for that place I was making now. It was Malay Jack's, whence I had been bound on the previous night when my strange meeting with the seaman who then possessed the pigtail had led to a change of plan.\",\n",
       " \" The scum of the Asiatic population always come at one time or another to Jack's, and I hoped by dint of a little patience to achieve what the police had now apparently despaired of achieving—the discovery of the assassin.\",\n",
       " ' Having called at my chambers to obtain my revolver, I mounted an eastward–bound motor–bus. The night, as I have already stated, was exceptionally dark. There was no moon, and heavy clouds were spread over the sky; so that the deserted East End streets presented a sufficiently uninviting aspect, but one with which I was by no means unfamiliar and which certainly in no way daunted me.',\n",
       " \" Changing at Paul Harley's Chinatown base in Wade Street, I turned my steps in the same direction as upon the preceding night; but if my own will played no part in the matter, then decidedly Providence truly guided me.\",\n",
       " ' Poetic justice is rare enough in real life, yet I was destined to–night to witness swift retribution overtaking a malefactor. The by–ways which I had trodden were utterly deserted; I was far from the lighted high road, and the only signs of human activity that reached me came from the adjacent river; therefore, when presently an outcry arose from somewhere on my left, for a moment I really believed that my imagination was vividly reproducing the episode of the night before! A furious scuffle—between a European and an Asiatic—was in progress not twenty yards away! Realizing that such was indeed the case, and that I was not the victim of hallucination, I advanced slowly in the direction of the sounds, but my footsteps reechoed hollowly from wall to wall of the narrow passage–way, and my coming brought the conflict to a sudden and dramatic termination.',\n",
       " ' \"Thought I wouldn\\'t know yer ugly face, did yer?\" yelled a familiar voice. \"No good squealin\\'—I got yer! I\\'d bust you up if I could!\" (a sound of furious blows and inarticulate chattering) \"but it ain\\'t \\'umanly possible to kill a Chink―—\" I hurried forward toward the spot where two dim figures were locked in deadly conflict.',\n",
       " ' \"Take that to remember me by!\" gasped the husky voice as I ran up. One of the figures collapsed in a heap upon the ground. The other made off at a lumbering gait along a second and even narrower passage branching at right angles from that in which the scuffle had taken place.',\n",
       " ' The clatter of the heavy sea–boots died away in the distance. I stood beside the fallen man, looking keenly about to right and left; for an impression was strong upon me that another than I had been witness of the scene—that a shadowy form had slunk back furtively at my approach.',\n",
       " ' But the night gave up no sound in confirmation of this, and I could detect no sign of any lurker. I stooped over the Chinaman (for a Chinaman it was) who lay at my feet, and directed the ray of my pocket–lamp upon his yellow and contorted countenance.',\n",
       " ' I suppressed a cry of surprise and horror. Despite the human impossibility referred to by the missing fireman, this particular Chinaman had joined the shades of his ancestors. I think that final blow, which had felled him, had brought his shaven skull in such violent contact with the wall that he had died of the thundering concussion set up.',\n",
       " ' Kneeling there and looking into his upturned eyes, I became aware that my position was not an enviable one, particularly since I felt little disposed to set the law on the track of the real culprit. For this man who now lay dead at my feet was doubtless one of the pair who had attempted the life of the fireman of the Jupiter.',\n",
       " ' That my seafaring acquaintance had designed to kill the Chinaman I did not believe, despite his stormy words: the death had been an accident, and (perhaps my morality was over–broad) I considered the assault to have been justified.',\n",
       " \" Now my ideas led me further yet. The dead Chinaman wore a rough blue coat, and gingerly, for I found the contact repulsive, I inserted my hand into the inside pocket. Immediately my fingers closed upon a familiar object—and I stood up, whistling slightly, and dangling in my left hand the missing pigtail! Beyond doubt Justice had guided the seaman's blows.\",\n",
       " ' This was the man who had murdered my dark–eyed visitor! I stood perfectly still, directing the little white ray of my flashlight upon the pigtail in my hand. I realized that my position, difficult before, now was become impossible; the possession of the pigtail compromised me hopelessly.',\n",
       " ' What should I do? \"My God!\" I said aloud, \"what does it all mean?\" \"It means,\" said a gruff voice, \"that it was lucky I was following you and saw what happened!\" I whirled about, my heart leaping wildly.',\n",
       " ' Detective–Sergeant Durham was standing watching me, a grim smile upon his face! I laughed rather shakily. \"Lucky indeed!\" I said. \"Thank God you\\'re here. This pigtail is a nightmare which threatens to drive me mad!\" The detective advanced and knelt beside the crumpled–up figure on the ground.',\n",
       " ' He examined it briefly, and then stood up. \"The fact that he had the missing pigtail in his pocket,\" he said, \"is proof enough to my mind that he did the murder.\" \"And to mine.\" \"There\\'s another point,\" he added, \"which throws a lot of light on the matter.',\n",
       " ' You and Mr. Harley were out of town at the time of the Huang Chow case; but the Chief and I outlined it, you remember, one night in Mr. Harley\\'s rooms?\" \"I remember it perfectly; the giant spider in the coffin―—\" \"Yes; and a certain Ah Fu, confidential servant of the old man, who used to buy the birds the thing fed on.',\n",
       " ' Well, Mr. Knox, Huang Chow was the biggest dealer in illicit stuff in all the East End—and this battered thing at our feet is—Ah Fu!\" \"Huang Chow\\'s servant?\" \"Exactly!\" I stared, uncomprehendingly, and: \"In what way does this throw light on the matter?\" I asked.',\n",
       " ' Durham—a very intelligent young officer—smiled significantly. \"I begin to see light!\" he declared. \"The gentleman who made off just as I arrived on the scene probably had a private quarrel with the Chinaman and was otherwise not concerned in any way.',\n",
       " '\" \"I am disposed to agree with you,\" I said guardedly. \"Of course, you\\'ve no idea of his identity?\" \"I\\'m afraid not.\" \"We may find him,\" mused the officer, glancing at me shrewdly, \"by applying at the offices of the Planet Line, but I rather doubt it.',\n",
       " ' Also I rather doubt if we\\'ll look very far. He\\'s saved us a lot of trouble, but\"—peering about in the shadowy corners which abounded—\"didn\\'t I see somebody else lurking around here?\" \"I\\'m almost certain there was someone else!\" I cried.',\n",
       " ' \"In fact, I could all but swear to it.\" \"H\\'m!\" said the detective. \"He\\'s not here now. Might I trouble you to walk along to Limehouse Police Station for the ambulance? I\\'d better stay here.\" I agreed at once, and started off.',\n",
       " ' Thus a second time my plans were interrupted, for my expedition that night ultimately led me to Bow Street, whence, after certain formalities had been observed, I departed for my chambers, the mysterious pigtail in my pocket.',\n",
       " ' Failing the presence of Durham, the pigtail must have been retained as evidence, but: \"We shall know where to find it if it\\'s wanted, Mr. Knox,\" said the Yard man, \"and I can trust you to look after your own property.',\n",
       " '\" The clock of St. Paul\\'s was chiming the hour of two when I locked the door of my chambers and prepared to turn in. The clangour of the final strokes yet vibrated through the night\\'s silence when someone set my own door bell loudly ringing.',\n",
       " ' With an exclamation of annoyance I shot back the bolts and threw open the door. A Chinaman stood outside upon the mat!.',\n",
       " 'IV: How It All Ended \"Me wishee see you,\" said the apparition, smiling blandly; \"me comee in?\" \"Come in, by all means,\" I said without enthusiasm, and, switching on the light in my study, I admitted the Chinaman and stood facing him with an expression upon my face which I doubt not was the reverse of agreeable.',\n",
       " ' My visitor, who wore a slop–shop suit, also wore a wide–brimmed bowler hat; now, the set bland smile still upon his yellow face, he removed the bowler and pointed significantly to his skull. His pigtail had been severed some three inches from the root! \"You gotchee my pigtail,\" he explained; \"me callee get it—thank you.',\n",
       " '\" \"Thank you,\" I said grimly. \"But I must ask you to establish your claim rather more firmly.\" \"Yessir,\" agreed the Chinaman. And thereupon in tolerable pidgin English he unfolded his tale. He proclaimed his name to be Hi Wing Ho, and his profession that of a sailor, or so I understood him.',\n",
       " ' While ashore at Suez he had become embroiled with some drunken seamen: knives had been drawn, and in the scuffle by some strange accident his pigtail had been severed. He had escaped from the conflict, badly frightened, and had run a great distance before he realized his loss.',\n",
       " ' Since Southern Chinamen of his particular Tong hold their pigtails in the highest regard, he had instituted inquiries as soon as possible, and had presently learned from a Chinese member of the crew of the S.',\n",
       " 'S. Jupiter that the precious queue had fallen into the hands of a fireman on that vessel. He (Hi Wing Ho) had shipped on the first available steamer bound for England, having in the meanwhile communicated with his friend on the Jupiter respecting the recovery of the pigtail.',\n",
       " ' \"What was the name of your friend on the Jupiter?\" \"Him Li Ping—yessir!\"—without the least hesitation or hurry. I nodded. \"Go on,\" I said. He arrived at the London docks very shortly after the Jupiter.',\n",
       " ' Indeed, the crew of the latter vessel had not yet been paid off when Hi Wing Ho presented himself at the dock gates. He admitted that, finding the fireman so obdurate, he and his friend Li Ping had resorted to violence, but he did not seem to recognize me as the person who had frustrated their designs.',\n",
       " ' Thus far I found his story credible enough, excepting the accidental severing of the pigtail at Suez, but now it became wildly improbable, for he would have me believe that Li Ping, or Ah Fu, obtaining possession of the pigtail (in what manner Hi Wing Ho protested that he knew not) he sought to hold it to ransom, knowing how highly Hi Wing Ho valued it.',\n",
       " ' I glared sternly at the Chinaman, but his impassive countenance served him well. That he was lying to me I no longer doubted; for Ah Fu could not have hoped to secure such a price as would justify his committing murder; furthermore, the presence of the unfortunate Jewess in the case was not accounted for by the ingenious narrative of Hi Wing Ho.',\n",
       " ' I was standing staring at him and wondering what course to adopt, when yet again my restless door–bell clamoured in the silence. Hi Wing Ho started nervously, exhibiting the first symptoms of alarm which I had perceived in him.',\n",
       " ' My mind was made up in an instant. I took my revolver from the drawer and covered him. \"Be good enough to open the door, Hi Wing Ho,\" I said coldly. He shrank from me, pouring forth voluble protestations.',\n",
       " ' \"Open the door!\" I clenched my left fist and advanced upon him. He scuttled away with his odd Chinese gait and threw open the door. Standing before me I saw my friend Detective Sergeant Durham, and with him a remarkably tall and very large–boned man whose square–jawed face was deeply tanned and whose aspect was dourly Scottish.',\n",
       " ' When the piercing eyes of this stranger rested upon Hi Wing Ho an expression which I shall never forget entered into them; an expression coldly murderous. As for the Chinaman, he literally crumpled up.',\n",
       " ' \"You rat!\" roared the stranger. Taking one long stride he stooped upon the Chinaman, seized him by the back of the neck as a terrier might seize a rat, and lifted him to his feet. \"The mystery of the pigtail, Mr.',\n",
       " ' Knox,\" said the detective, \"is solved at last.\" \"Have ye got it?\" demanded the Scotsman, turning to me, but without releasing his hold upon the neck of Hi Wing Ho. I took the pigtail from my pocket and dangled it before his eyes.',\n",
       " ' \"Suppose you come into my study,\" I said, \"and explain matters.\" We entered the room which had been the scene of so many singular happenings. The detective and I seated ourselves, but the Scotsman, holding the Chinaman by the neck as though he had been some inanimate bundle, stood just within the doorway, one of the most gigantic specimens of manhood I had ever set eyes upon.',\n",
       " ' \"You do the talking, sir,\" he directed the detective; \"ye have all the facts.\" While Durham talked, then, we all listened—excepting the Chinaman, who was past taking an intelligent interest in anything, and who, to judge from his starting eyes, was being slowly strangled.',\n",
       " ' \"The gentleman,\" said Durham—\"Mr. Nicholson—arrived two days ago from the East. He is a buyer for a big firm of diamond merchants, and some weeks ago a valuable diamond was stolen from him―—\" \"By this!\" interrupted the Scotsman, shaking the wretched Hi Wing Ho terrier fashion.',\n",
       " ' \"By Hi Wing Ho,\" explained the detective, \"whom you see before you. The theft was a very ingenious one, and the man succeeded in getting away with his haul. He tried to dispose of the diamond to a certain Isaac Cohenberg, a Singapore moneylender; but Isaac Cohenberg was the bigger crook of the two.',\n",
       " ' Hi Wing Ho only escaped from the establishment of Cohenberg by dint of sandbagging the moneylender, and quitted the town by a boat which left the same night. On the voyage he was indiscreet enough to take the diamond from its hiding–place and surreptitiously to examine it.',\n",
       " ' Another member of the Chinese crew, one Li Ping—otherwise Ah Fu, the accredited agent of old Huang Chow!—was secretly watching our friend, and, knowing that he possessed this valuable jewel, he also learned where he kept it hidden.',\n",
       " ' At Suez Ah Fu attacked Hi Wing Ho and secured possession of the diamond. It was to secure possession of the diamond that Ah Fu had gone out East. I don\\'t doubt it. He employed Hi Wing Ho—and Hi Wing Ho tried to double on him! \"We are indebted to you, Mr.',\n",
       " ' Knox, for some of the data upon which we have reconstructed the foregoing and also for the next link in the narrative. A fireman ashore from the Jupiter intruded upon the scene at Suez and deprived Ah Fu of the fruits of his labours.',\n",
       " ' Hi Wing Ho seems to have been badly damaged in the scuffle, but Ah Fu, the more wily of the two, evidently followed the fireman, and, deserting from his own ship, signed on with the Jupiter.\" While this story was enlightening in some respects, it was mystifying in others.',\n",
       " ' I did not interrupt, however, for Durham immediately resumed: \"The drama was complicated by the presence of a fourth character—the daughter of Cohenberg. Realizing that a small fortune had slipped through his fingers, the old moneylender dispatched his daughter in pursuit of Hi Wing Ho, having learned upon which vessel the latter had sailed.',\n",
       " ' He had no difficulty in obtaining this information, for he is in touch with all the crooks of the town. Had he known that the diamond had been stolen by an agent of Huang Chow, he would no doubt have hesitated.',\n",
       " ' Huang Chow has an international reputation. \"However, his daughter—a girl of great personal beauty—relied upon her diplomatic gifts to regain possession of the stone, but, poor creature, she had not counted with Ah Fu, who was evidently watching your chambers (while Hi Wing Ho, it seems, was assiduously shadowing Ah Fu!).',\n",
       " ' How she traced the diamond from point to point of its travels we do not know, and probably never shall know, but she was undeniably clever and unscrupulous. Poor girl! She came to a dreadful end. Mr. Nicholson, here, identified her at Bow Street to–night.',\n",
       " '\" Now the whole amazing truth burst upon me. \"I understand!\" I cried. \"This\"—and I snatched up the pigtail— \"That my pigtail,\" moaned Hi Wing Ho feebly. Mr. Nicholson pitched him unceremoniously into a corner of the room, and taking the pigtail in his huge hand, clumsily unfastened it.',\n",
       " \" Out from the thick part, some two inches below the point at which it had been cut from the Chinaman's head, a great diamond dropped upon the floor! For perhaps twenty seconds there was perfect silence in my study.\",\n",
       " ' No one stooped to pick the diamond from the floor—the diamond which now had blood upon it. No one, so far as my sense informed me, stirred. But when, following those moments of stupefaction, we all looked up—Hi Wing Ho, like a phantom, had faded from the room!.',\n",
       " 'The House of Golden JossI: The Blood-stained Idol \"Stop when we pass the next lamp and give me a light for my pipe.\" \"Why?\" \"No! don\\'t look round,\" warned my companion. \"I think someone is following us.',\n",
       " ' And it is always advisable to be on guard in this neighbourhood.\" We had nearly reached the house in Wade Street, Limehouse, which my friend used as a base for East End operations. The night was dark but clear, and I thought that presently when dawn came it would bring a cold, bright morning.',\n",
       " ' There was no moon, and as we passed the lamp and paused we stood in almost total darkness. Facing in the direction of the Council School I struck a match. It revealed my ruffianly looking companion—in whom his nearest friends must have failed to recognize Mr.',\n",
       " ' Paul Harley of Chancery Lane. He was glancing furtively back along the street, and when a moment later we moved on, I too, had detected the presence of a figure stumbling toward us. \"Don\\'t stop at the door,\" whispered Harley, for our follower was only a few yards away.',\n",
       " ' Accordingly we passed the house in which Harley had rooms, and had proceeded some fifteen paces farther when the man who was following us stumbled in between Harley and myself, clutching an arm of either.',\n",
       " ' I scarcely knew what to expect, but was prepared for anything, when: \"Mates!\" said a man huskily. \"Mates, if you know where I can get a drink, take me there!\" Harley laughed shortly. I cannot say if he remained suspicious of the newcomer, but for my own part I had determined after one glance at the man that he was merely a drunken fireman newly recovered from a prolonged debauch.',\n",
       " ' \"Where \\'ave yer been, old son?\" growled Harley, in that wonderful dialect of his which I had so often and so vainly sought to cultivate. \"You look as though you\\'d \\'ad one too many already.\" \"I ain\\'t,\" declared the fireman, who appeared to be in a semi–dazed condition.',\n",
       " ' \"I ain\\'t \\'ad one since ten o\\'clock last night. It\\'s dope wot\\'s got me, not rum.\" \"Dope!\" said Harley sharply; \"been \\'avin\\' a pipe, eh?\" \"If you\\'ve got a corpse–reviver anywhere,\" continued the man in that curious, husky voice, \"\\'ave pity on me, mate.',\n",
       " ' I seen a thing to–night wot give me the jim–jams.\" \"All right, old son,\" said my friend good–humouredly; \"about turn! I\\'ve got a drop in the bottle, but me an\\' my mate sails to–morrow, an\\' it\\'s the last.',\n",
       " '\" \"Gawd bless yer!\" growled the fireman; and the three of us—an odd trio, truly—turned about, retracing our steps. As we approached the street lamp and its light shone upon the haggard face of the man walking between us, Harley stopped, and: \"Wot\\'s up with yer eye?\" he inquired.',\n",
       " ' He suddenly tilted the man\\'s head upward and peered closely into one of his eyes. I suppressed a gasp of surprise for I instantly recognized the fireman of the Jupiter! \"Nothin\\' up with it, is there?\" said the fireman.',\n",
       " ' \"Only a lump o\\' mud,\" growled Harley, and with a very dirty handkerchief he pretended to remove the imaginary stain, and then, turning to me: \"Open the door, Jim,\" he directed. His examination of the man\\'s eyes had evidently satisfied him that our acquaintance had really been smoking opium.',\n",
       " ' We paused immediately outside the house for which we had been bound, and as I had the key I opened the door and the three of us stepped into a little dark room. Harley closed the door and we stumbled upstairs to a low first–floor apartment facing the street.',\n",
       " ' There was nothing in its appointments, as revealed in the light of an oil lamp burning on the solitary table, to distinguish it from a thousand other such apartments which may be leased for a few shillings a week in the neighbourhood.',\n",
       " ' That adjoining might have told a different story, for it more closely resembled an actor\\'s dressing–room than a seaman\\'s lodging; but the door of this sanctum was kept scrupulously locked. \"Sit down, old son,\" said my friend heartily, pushing forward an old arm–chair.',\n",
       " ' \"Fetch out the grog, Jim; there\\'s about enough for three.\" I walked to a cupboard, as the fireman sank limply down in the chair, and took out a bottle and three glasses. When the man, who, as I could now see quite plainly, was suffering from the after effects of opium, had eagerly gulped the stiff drink which I handed to him, he looked around with dim, glazed eyes, and: \"You\\'ve saved my life, mates,\" he declared.',\n",
       " ' \"I\\'ve \\'ad a \\'orrible nightmare, I \\'ave—a nightmare. See?\" He fixed his eyes on me for a moment, then raised himself from his seat, peering narrowly at me across the table. \"I seed you before, mate. Gaw, blimey! if you ain\\'t the bloke wot I giv\\'d the pigtail to! And wot laid out that blasted Chink as was scraggin\\' me! Shake, mate!\" I shook hands with him, Harley eyeing me closely the while, in a manner which told me that his quick brain had already supplied the link connecting our doped acquaintance with my strange experience during his absence.',\n",
       " ' At the same time it occurred to me that my fireman friend did not know that Ah Fu was dead, or he would never have broached the subject so openly. \"That\\'s so,\" I said, and wondered if he required further information.',\n",
       " ' \"It\\'s all right, mate. I don\\'t want to \\'ear no more about blinking pigtails—not all my life I don\\'t,\" and he sat back heavily in his chair and stared at Harley. \"Where have you been?\" inquired Harley, as if no interruption had occurred, and then began to reload his pipe: \"at Malay Jack\\'s or at Number Fourteen?\" \"Neither of \\'em!\" cried the fireman, some evidence of animation appearing in his face; \"I been at Kwen Lung\\'s.',\n",
       " '\" \"In Pennyfields?\" \"That\\'s \\'im, the old bloke with the big joss. I allers goes to see Ma Lorenzo when I\\'m in Port o\\' London. I\\'ve seen \\'er for the last time, mates.\" He banged a big and dirty hand upon the table.',\n",
       " ' \"Last night I see murder done, an\\' only that I know they wouldn\\'t believe me, I\\'d walk across to Limehouse P\\'lice Station presently and put the splits on \\'em, I would.\" Harley, who was seated behind the speaker, glanced at me significantly.',\n",
       " ' \"Sure you wasn\\'t dreamin\\'?\" he inquired facetiously. \"Dreamin\\'!\" cried the man. \"Dreams don\\'t leave no blood be\\'ind, do they?\" \"Blood!\" I exclaimed. \"That\\'s wot I said—blood!

       " '\" \"Eh!\" said Harley. \"Blood on whose shoulders? Wot the \\'ell are you talkin\\' about, old son?\" \"Ere\"—the fireman turned in his chair and grasped Harley by the arm—\"listen to me, and I\\'ll tell you somethink, I will.',\n",
       " \" I'm goin' in the Seahawk in the mornin' see? But if you want to know somethink, I'll tell yer. Drunk or sober I bars the blasted p'lice, but if you like to tell 'em I'll put you on somethink worth tellin'.\",\n",
       " ' Sure the bottle\\'s empty, mates?\" I caught Harley\\'s glance and divided the remainder of the whisky evenly between the three glasses. \"Good \\'ealth,\" said the fireman, and disposed of his share at a draught.',\n",
       " ' \"That\\'s bucked me up wonderful.\" He lay back in his chair and from a little tobacco–box began to fill a short clay pipe. \"Look \\'ere, mates, I\\'m soberin\\' up, like, after the smoke, an\\' I can see, I can see plain, as nobody\\'ll ever believe me.',\n",
       " ' Nobody ever does, worse luck, but \\'ere goes. Pass the matches.\" He lighted his pipe, and looking about him in a sort of vaguely aggressive way: \"Last night,\" he resumed, \"after I was chucked out of the Dock Gates, I made up my mind to go and smoke a pipe with old Ma Lorenzo.',\n",
       " ' Round I goes to Pennyfields, and she don\\'t seem glad to see me. There\\'s nobody there only me. Not like the old days when you \\'ad to book your seat in advance.\" He laughed gruffly. \"She didn\\'t want to let me in at first, said they was watched, that if a Chink \\'ad an old pipe wot \\'ad b\\'longed to \\'is grandfather it was good enough to get \\'im fined fifty quid.',\n",
       " \" Anyway, me bein' an old friend she spread a mat for me and filled me a pipe.

       " '\" He paused and looked about him defiantly. \"I dunno \\'ow long I slept,\" he continued, \"but some time in the night I kind of \\'alf woke up.\" At that he twisted violently in his chair and glared across at Harley: \"You been a pal to me,\" he said; \"but tell me I was dreamin\\' again and I\\'ll smash yer bloody face!\" He glared for a while, then addressing his narrative more particularly to me, he resumed: \"It was a scream wot woke me—a woman\\'s scream.',\n",
       " \" I didn't sit up; I couldn't. I never felt like it before. It was the same as bein' buried alive, I should think. I could see an' I could 'ear, but I couldn't move one muscle in my body. Foller me? An' wot did I see, mates, an' wot did I 'ear? I'm goin' to tell yer.\",\n",
       " ' I see old Kwen Lung\\'s daughter―—\" \"I didn\\'t know \\'e \\'ad one,\" murmured Harley. \"Then you don\\'t know much!\" shouted the fireman. \"I knew years ago, but \\'e kept \\'er stowed away somewhere up above, an\\' last night was the first time I ever see \\'er.',\n",
       " ' It was \\'er shriek wot \\'ad reached me, reached me through the smoke. I don\\'t take much stock in Chink gals in general, but this one\\'s mother was no Chink, I\\'ll swear. She was just as pretty as a bloomin\\' ivory doll, an\\' as little an\\' as white, and that old swine Kwen Lung \\'ad tore the dress off of \\'er shoulders with a bloody great whip!\" Harley was leaning forward in his seat now, intent upon the man\\'s story, and although I could not get rid of the idea that our friend was relating the events of a particularly unpleasant opium dream, nevertheless I was fascinated by the strange story and by the strange manner of its telling.',\n",
       " ' \"I saw the blood drip from \\'er bare shoulders, mates,\" the man continued huskily, and with his big dirty hands he strove to illustrate his words. \"An\\' that old yellow devil lashed an\\' lashed until the poor gal was past screamin\\'.',\n",
       " ' She just sunk down on the floor all of a \\'cap, moanin\\' and moanin\\'—Gawd!

       " \" I remember all this as clear as print, mates, remember it plain, but wot 'appened next ain't so good an' clear. Somethink seemed to bust in me 'ead. Only just before I went off, the winder—there's only one in the room—was smashed to smithereens an' somebody come in through it.\",\n",
       " '\" \"Are you sure?\" said Harley eagerly. \"Are you sure?\" That he was intensely absorbed in the story he revealed by a piece of bad artistry, very rare in him. He temporarily forgot his dialect. Our marine friend, however, was too much taken up with his own story to notice the slip, and: \"Dead sure!\" he shouted.',\n",
       " ' He suddenly twisted around in his chair. \"Tell me I was dreamin\\', mate,\" he invited, \"and if you ain\\'t dreamin\\' in \\'arf a tick it won\\'t be because I \\'aven\\'t put yer to sleep!\" \"I ain\\'t arguin\\', old son,\" said Harley soothingly.',\n",
       " ' \"Get on with your yarn.\" \"Ho!\" said the fireman, mollified, \"so long as you ain\\'t. Well, then, it\\'s all blotted out after that. Somebody come in at the winder, but \\'oo it was or wot it was I can\\'t tell yer, not for fifty quid.',\n",
       " \" When I woke up, which is about 'arf an hour before you see me, I'm all alone—see? There's no sign of Kwen Lung nor the gal nor old Ma Lorenzo nor anybody. I sez to meself, wot you keep on sayin'. I sez, 'You're dreamin', Bill.\",\n",
       " '\\'\" \"But I don\\'t think you was,\" declared Harley. \"Straight I don\\'t.\" \"I know I wasn\\'t!\" roared the fireman, and banged the table lustily. \"I see \\'er blood on the joss an\\' on the floor where she lay!\" \"This morning?\" I interjected.',\n",
       " ' \"This mornin\\', in the light of the little oil lamp where old Ma Lorenzo \\'ad roasted the pills! It\\'s all still an\\' quiet an\\' I feel more dead than alive. I\\'m goin\\' to give \\'er a hail, see? When I sez to myself, \\'Bill,\\' I sez, \\'put out to sea; you\\'re amongst Kaffirs, Bill.',\n",
       " '\\' It occurred to me as old Kwen Lung might wonder \\'ow much I knew. So I beat it. But when I got in the open air I felt I\\'d never make my lodgin\\'s without a tonic.

       " ' Drunk or sober, I never could stand the splits, but mates\"—he stood up, and grasping me by the arm, he drew me across the room where he also seized Harley in his muscular grip—\"mates,\" he went on earnestly, \"she was the sweetest, prettiest little gal as a man ever clapped eyes on.',\n",
       " ' One of yer walk into Limehouse Station an\\' put the koppers wise. I\\'d sleep easier at sea if I knew old Kwen Lung \\'ad gone west on a bloody rope\\'s end.\".',\n",
       " 'II: At Kwen Lung\\'s For fully ten minutes after the fireman had departed Paul Harley sat staring abstractedly in front of him, his cold pipe between his teeth, and knowing his moods I intruded no words upon this reverie, until: \"Come on, Knox,\" he said, standing up suddenly, \"I think this matter calls for speedy action.',\n",
       " '\" \"What! Do you think the man\\'s story was true?\" \"I think nothing. I am going to look at Kwen Lung\\'s joss.\" Without another word he led the way downstairs and out into the deserted street. The first gray halftones of dawn were creeping into the sky, so that the outlines of Limehouse loomed like dim silhouettes about us.',\n",
       " ' There was abundant evidence in the form of noises, strange and discordant, that many workers were busy on dock and riverside, but the streets through which our course lay were almost empty. Sometimes a furtive shadow would move out of some black gully and fade into a dimly seen doorway in a manner peculiarly unpleasant and Asiatic.',\n",
       " ' But we met no palpable pedestrian throughout the journey. Before the door of a house in Pennyfields which closely resembled that which we had left in Wade Street, in that it was flatly uninteresting, dirty and commonplace, we paused.',\n",
       " ' There was no sign of life about the place and no lights showed at any of the windows, which appeared as dim cavities—eyeless sockets in the gray face of the building, as dawn proclaimed the birth of a new day.',\n",
       " ' Harley seized the knocker and knocked sharply. There was no response, and he repeated the summons, but again without effect. Thereupon, with a muttered exclamation, he grasped the knocker a third time and executed a veritable tattoo upon the door.',\n",
       " ' When this had proceeded for about half a minute or more: \"All right, all right!\" came a shaky voice from within. \"I\\'m coming.\" Harley released the knocker, and, turning to me: \"Ma Lorenzo,\" he whispered.',\n",
       " ' \"Don\\'t make any mistakes.\" Indeed, even as he warned me, heralded by a creaking of bolts and the rattling of a chain, the door was opened by a fat, shapeless, half–caste woman of indefinite age; in whose dark eyes, now sunken in bloated cheeks, in whose full though drooping lips, and even in the whole overlaid contour of whose face and figure it was possible to recognize the traces of former beauty.',\n",
       " ' This was Ma Lorenzo, who for many years had lived at that address with old Kwen Lung, of whom strange stories were told in Chinatown. As Bill Jones, A.B., my friend, Paul Harley, was well known to Ma Lorenzo as he was well known to many others in that strange colony which clusters round the London docks.',\n",
       " ' I sometimes enjoyed the privilege of accompanying my friend on a tour of investigation through the weird resorts which abound in that neighbourhood, and, indeed, we had been returning from one of these Baghdad nights when our present adventure had been thrust upon us.',\n",
       " ' Assuming a wild and boisterous manner which he had at command: \"\\'Urry up, Ma!\" said Harley, entering without ceremony; \"I want to introduce my pal Jim \\'ere to old Kwen Lung, and make it all right for him before I sail.',\n",
       " '\" Ma Lorenzo, who was half Portuguese, replied in her peculiar accent: \"This no time to come waking me up out of bed!\" But Harley, brushing past her, was already inside the stuffy little room, and I hastened to follow.',\n",
       " ' \"Kwen Lung!\" shouted my friend loudly. \"Where are you? Brought a friend to see you.\" \"Kwen Lung no hab,\" came the complaining tones of Ma Lorenzo from behind us. It was curious to note how long association with the Chinese had resulted in her catching the infection of that pidgin–English which is a sort of esperanto in all Asiatic quarters.',\n",
       " ' \"Eh!\" cried my friend, pushing open a door on the right of the passage and stumbling down three worn steps into a very evil–smelling room. \"Where is he?\" \"Go play fan–tan. Not come back.\" Ma Lorenzo, having relocked the street door, had rejoined us, and as I followed my friend down into the dim and uninviting apartment she stood at the top of the steps, hands on hips, regarding us.',\n",
       " ' The place, which was quite palpably an opium den, must have disappointed anyone familiar with the more ornate houses of Chinese vice in San Francisco and elsewhere. The bare floor was not particularly clean, and the few decorations which the room boasted were garishly European for the most part.',\n",
       " ' A deep divan, evidently used sometimes as a bed, occupied one side of the room, and just to the left of the steps reposed the only typically Oriental object in the place. It was a strange thing to see in so sordid a setting; a great gilded joss, more than life–size, squatting, hideous, upon a massive pedestal; a figure fit for some native temple but strangely out of place in that dirty little Limehouse abode.',\n",
       " \" I had never before visited Kwen Lung's, but the fame of his golden joss had reached me, and I know that he had received many offers for it, all of which he had rejected. It was whispered that Kwen Lung was rich, that he was a great man among the Chinese, and even that some kind of religious ceremony periodically took place in his house.\",\n",
       " ' Now, as I stood staring at the famous idol, I saw something which made me stare harder than ever. The place was lighted by a hanging lamp from which depended bits of coloured paper and several gilded silk tassels; but dim as the light was it could not conceal those tell–tale stains.',\n",
       " ' There was blood on the feet of the golden idol! All this I detected at a glance, but ere I had time to speak: \"You can\\'t tell me that tale, Ma!\" cried Harley. \"I believe \\'e was smokin\\' in \\'ere when we knocked.',\n",
       " '\" The woman shrugged her fat shoulders. \"No, hab,\" she repeated. \"You two johnnies clear out. Let me sleep.\" But as I turned to her, beneath the nonchalant manner I could detect a great uneasiness; and in her dark eyes there was fear.',\n",
       " ' That Harley also had seen the bloodstains I was well aware, and I did not doubt that furthermore he had noted the fact that the only mat which the room boasted had been placed before the joss—doubtless to hide other stains upon the boards.',\n",
       " ' As we stood so I presently became aware of a current of air passing across the room in the direction of the open door. It came from a window before which a tawdry red curtain had been draped. Either the window behind the curtain was wide open, which is alien to Chinese habits, or it was shattered.',\n",
       " ' While I was wondering if Harley intended to investigate further: \"Come on, Jim!\" he cried boisterously, and clapped me on the shoulder; \"the old fox don\\'t want to be disturbed.\" He turned to the woman: \"Tell him when he wakes up, Ma,\" he said, \"that if ever my pal Jim wants a pipe he\\'s to \\'ave one.',\n",
       " ' Savvy? Jim\\'s square.\" \"Savvy,\" replied the woman, and she was wholly unable to conceal her relief. \"You clear out now, and I tell Kwen Lung when he come in.\" \"Righto, Ma!\" said Harley. \"Kiss \\'im on both cheeks for me, an\\' tell \\'im I\\'ll be \\'ome again in a month.',\n",
       " '\" Grasping me by the arm he lurched up the steps, and the two of us presently found ourselves out in the street again. In the growing light the squalor of the district was more evident than ever, but the comparative freshness of the air was welcome after the reek of that room in which the golden idol sat leering, with blood at his feet.',\n",
       " ' \"You saw, Harley?\" I exclaimed excitedly. \"You saw the stains? And I\\'m certain the window was broken!\" Harley nodded shortly. \"Back to Wade Street!\" he said. \"I allow myself fifteen minutes to shed Bill Jones, able seaman, and to become Paul Harley, of Chancery Lane.',\n",
       " '\" As we hurried along: \"What steps shall you take?\" I asked. \"First step: search Kwen Lung\\'s house from cellar to roof. Second step: entirely dependent upon result of first. The Chinese are subtle, Knox.',\n",
       " ' If Kwen Lung has killed his daughter, it may require all the resources of Scotland Yard to prove it.\" \"But―—\" \"There is no \\'but\\' about it. Chinatown is the one district of London which possesses the property of swallowing people up.',\n",
       " 'III: \"Captain Dan\" Half an hour later, as I sat in the inner room before the great dressing–table laboriously removing my disguise—for I was utterly incapable of metamorphosing myself like Harley in seven minutes—I heard a rapping at the outer door.',\n",
       " ' I glanced nervously at my face in the mirror. Comparatively little of \"Jim\" had yet been removed, for since time was precious to my friend I had acted as his dresser before setting to work to remove my own make–up.',\n",
       " ' There were two entrances to the establishment, by one of which Paul Harley invariably entered and invariably went out, and from the other of which \"Bill Jones\" was sometimes seen to emerge, but never Paul Harley.',\n",
       " ' That my friend had made good his retirement I knew, but, nevertheless, if I had to open the door of the outer room it must be as \"Jim.\" Thinking it impolite not to do so, since the one who knocked might be aware that we had come in but not gone out again, I hastily readjusted that side of my moustache which I had begun to remove, replaced my cap and muffler, and carefully locking the door of the dressing–room, crossed the outer apartment and opened the door.',\n",
       " \" It was Harley's custom never to enter or leave these rooms except under the mantle of friendly night, but at so early an hour I confess I had not expected a visitor. Wondering whom I should find there I opened the door.\",\n",
       " ' Standing on the landing was a fellow–lodger who permanently occupied the two top rooms of the house. Paul Harley had taken the trouble to investigate the man\\'s past, for \"Captain Dan,\" the name by which he was known in the saloons and worse resorts which he frequented, was palpably a broken–down gentleman; a piece of flotsam caught in the yellow stream.',\n",
       " ' Opium had been his downfall. How he lived I never knew, but Harley believed he had some small but settled income, sufficient to enable him to kill himself in comfort with the black pills. As he stood there before me in the early morning light, I was aware of some subtle change in his appearance.',\n",
       " ' It was fully six months since I had seen him last, but in some vague way he looked younger. Haggard he was, with an ugly cut showing on his temple, but not so lined as I remembered him. Some former man seemed to be struggling through the opium–scarred surface.',\n",
       " ' His eyes were brighter, and I noted with surprise that he wore decent clothes and was clean shaved. \"Good morning, Jim,\" he said; \"you remember me, don\\'t you?\" As he spoke I observed, too, that his manner had altered.',\n",
       " ' He who had consorted with the sweepings af the doss–houses now addressed me as a courteous gentleman addresses an inferior—not haughtily or patronizingly, but with a note of conscious superiority and self–respect wholly unfamiliar.',\n",
       " ' Almost it threw me off my guard, but remembering in the nick of time that I was still \"Jim\": \"Of course I remember you, Cap\\'n,\" I said. \"Step inside.\" \"Thanks,\" he replied, and followed me into the little room.',\n",
       " ' I placed for him the arm–chair which our friend the fireman had so recently occupied, but: \"I won\\'t sit down,\" he said. And now I observed that he was evidently in a condition of repressed excitement.',\n",
       " ' Perhaps he saw the curiosity in my glance, for he suddenly rested both his hands on my shoulders, and: \"Yes, I have given up the dope, Jim,\" he said―\"done with it for ever. There\\'s not a soul in this neighbourhood I can trust, yet if ever a man wanted a pal, I want one to–day.',\n",
       " ' Now, you\\'re square, my lad. I always knew that, in spite of the dope; and if I ask you to do a little thing that means a lot to me, I think you will do it. Am I right?\" \"If it can be done, I\\'ll do it,\" said I.',\n",
       " ' \"Then, listen. I\\'m leaving England in the Patna for Singapore. She sails at noon to–morrow, and passengers go on board at ten o\\'clock. I\\'ve got my ticket, papers in order, but\"—he paused impressively, grasping my shoulders hard—\"I must get on board to–night.',\n",
       " '\" I stared him in the face. \"Why?\" I asked. He returned my look with one searching and eager; then: \"If I show you the reason,\" said he, \"and trust you with all my papers, will you go down to the dock—it\\'s no great distance—and ask to see Marryat, the chief officer? Perhaps you\\'ve sailed with him?\" \"No,\" I replied guardedly.',\n",
       " ' \"I was never in the Patna.\" \"Never mind. When you give him a letter which I shall write he will make the necessary arrangements for me to occupy my state–room to–night. I knew him well,\" he explained, \"in—the old days.',\n",
       " ' Will you do it, Jim?\" \"I\\'ll do it with pleasure,\" I answered. \"Shake!\" said Captain Dan. We shook hands heartily, and: \"Now I\\'ll show you the reason,\" he added. \"Come upstairs.\" Turning, he led the way upstairs to his own room, and wondering greatly, I followed him in.',\n",
       " \" Never having been in Captain Dan's apartments I cannot say whether they, like their occupant, had changed for the better. But I found myself in a room surprisingly clean and with a note of culture in its appointments which was even more surprising.\",\n",
       " ' On a couch by the window, wrapped in a fur rug, lay the prettiest half–caste girl I had ever seen, East or West. Her skin was like cream rose petals and her abundant hair was of wonderful lustrous black.',\n",
       " ' Perhaps it was her smooth warm colour which suggested the idea, but as her cheeks flushed at sight of Captain Dan and the long dark eyes lighted up in welcome, I thought of a delicate painting on ivory and I wondered more and more what it all could mean.',\n",
       " ' \"I have brought Jim to see you,\" said Captain Dan. \"No, don\\'t trouble to move dear.\" But even before he had spoken I had seen the girl wince with pain as she had endeavoured to sit up to greet us. She lay on her side in a rather constrained attitude, but although her sudden movement had brought tears to her eyes she smiled bravely and extended a tiny ivory hand to me.',\n",
       " ' \"This is my wife, Jim!\" said Captain Dan. I could find no words at all, but merely stood there looking very awkward and feeling almost awed by the indescribable expression of trust in the eyes of the little Eurasian, as with her tiny fingers hidden in her husband\\'s clasp she lay looking up at him.',\n",
       " ' \"Now you know, Jim,\" said he, \"why we must get aboard the Patna to–night. My wife is really too ill to travel; in fact, I shall have to carry her down to the cab, and such a proceeding in daylight would attract an enormous crowd in this neighbourhood!\" \"Give me the letters and the papers,\" I answered.',\n",
       " ' \"I will start now.\" His wife disengaged her hand and extended it to me. \"Thank you,\" she said, in a queer little silver–bell voice; \"you are good. I shall always love you.\".',\n",
       " \"IV: The Secret of Ma Lorenzo It must have been about eleven o'clock that night when Paul Harley rang me up. Since we had parted in the early morning I had had no word from him, and I was all anxiety to tell him of the quaint little romance which unknown to us had had its setting in the room above.\",\n",
       " ' In accordance with my promise I had seen the chief officer of the Patna; and from the start of surprise which he gave on opening \"Captain Dan\\'s\" letter, I judged that Mr. Marryat and the man who for so long had sunk to the lowest rung of the ladder had been close friends in those \"old days.',\n",
       " '\" At any rate, he had proceeded to make the necessary arrangements without a moment\\'s delay, and the couple were to go on board the Patna at nine o\\'clock. It was with a sense of having done at least one good deed that I finally quitted our Limehouse base and returned to my rooms.',\n",
       " ' Now, at eleven o\\'clock at night: \"Can you come round to Chancery Lane at once?\" said Harley. \"I want you to run down to Pennyfields with me.\" \"Some development in the Kwen Lung business?\" \"Hardly a development, but I\\'m not satisfied, Knox.',\n",
       " ' I hate to be beaten.\" Twenty minutes later I was sitting in Harley\\'s study, watching him restlessly promenading up and down before the fire. \"The police searched Kwen Lung\\'s place from foundation to tiles,\" he said.',\n",
       " ' \"I was there myself. Old Kwen Lung conveniently kept out of the way—still playing fan–tan, no doubt! But Ma Lorenzo was in evidence. She blandly declared that Kwen Lung never had a daughter! And in the absence of our friend the fireman, who sailed in the Seahawk, and whose evidence, by the way, is legally valueless—what could we do? They could find nobody in the neighbourhood prepared to state that Kwen Lung had a daughter or that Kwen Lung had no daughter.',\n",
       " ' There are all sorts of fables about the old fox, but the facts about him are harder to get at.\" \"But,\" I explained, \"the bloodstains on the joss!\" \"Ma Lorenzo stumbled and fell there on the previous night, striking her skull against the foot of the figure.',\n",
       " '\" \"What nonsense!\" I cried. \"We should have seen the wound last night.\" \"We might have done,\" said Harley musingly; \"I don\\'t know when she inflicted it on herself; but I did see it this morning.\" \"What!\" \"Oh, the gash is there all right, partly covered by her hair.',\n",
       " '\" He stood still, staring at me oddly. \"One meets with cases of singular devotion in unexpected quarters sometimes,\" he said. \"You mean that the woman inflicted the wound upon herself in order―—\" \"To save old Kwen Lung—exactly! It\\'s marvellous.',\n",
       " '\" \"Good heavens!\" I exclaimed. \"And the window?\" \"Oh! it was broken right enough—by two drunken sailormen fighting in the court outside! Sash and everything smashed to splinters.\" He began irritably to pace the carpet again.',\n",
       " ' \"It must have been a devil of a fight!\" he added savagely. \"Meanwhile,\" said I, \"where is old Kwen Lung hiding?\" \"But more particularly,\" cried Harley, \"where has he hidden the poor victim? Come along, Knox! I\\'m going down there for a final look round.',\n",
       " '\" \"Of course the premises are being watched?\" \"Of course—and also, of course, I shall be the laughing stock of Scotland Yard if nothing results.\" It was close on midnight when once more I found myself in Pennyfields.',\n",
       " ' Carried away by Harley\\'s irritable excitement I had quite forgotten the romance of Captain Dan; and when, having exchanged greetings with the detective on duty hard by the house of Kwen Lung, we presently found ourselves in the presence of Ma Lorenzo, I scarcely knew for a moment if I were \"Jim\" or my proper self.',\n",
       " ' \"Is Kwen Lung in?\" asked Harley sternly. The woman shook her head. \"No,\" she replied; \"he sometimes stop away a whole week.\" \"Does he?\" jerked Harley. \"Come in, Knox; we\\'ll take another look round.\" A moment later I found myself again in the room of the golden joss.',\n",
       " ' The red curtain had been removed from before the shattered window, but otherwise the place looked exactly as it had looked before. The atmosphere was much less stale, however, but there was something repellent about the great gilded idol smiling eternally from his pedestal beside the door.',\n",
       " ' I stared into the leering face, and it was the face of one who knew and who might have said: \"Yes! this and other things equally strange have I beheld in many lands as well as England. Much I could tell.',\n",
       " ' Many things grim and terrible, and some few joyous; for behold! I smile but am silent.\" For a while Harley stared abstractedly at the bloodstains on the pedestal of the joss and upon the floor beneath from which the matting had been pulled back.',\n",
       " ' Suddenly he turned to Ma Lorenzo: \"Where have you hidden the body?\" he demanded. Watching her, I thought I saw the woman flinch, but there was enough of the Oriental in her composition to save her from self–betrayal.',\n",
       " ' She shook her head slowly, watching Harley through half–closed eyes. \"Nobody hab,\" she replied. And I thought for once that her lapse into pidgin had been deliberate and not accidental. When finally we quitted the house of the missing Kwen Lung, and when, Harley having curtly acknowledged \"good night\" from the detective on duty, we came out into Limehouse Causeway.',\n",
       " ' \"You have not overlooked the possibility, Harley,\" I said, \"that this woman\\'s explanation may be true, and that the fireman of the Seahawk may have been entertaining us with an account of a weird dream?\" \"No!\" snapped Harley—\"neither will Scotland Yard overlook it.',\n",
       " '\" He was in a particularly impossible mood, for he so rarely made mistakes that to be detected in one invariably brought out those petulant traits of character which may have been due in some measure to long residence in the East.',\n",
       " \" Recognizing that he would rather be alone I parted from him at the corner of Chancery Lane and returned to my own chambers. Furthermore, I was very tired, for it was close upon two o'clock, and on turning in I very promptly went to sleep, nor did I awaken until late in the morning.\",\n",
       " ' For some odd reason, but possibly because the fact had occurred to me just as I was retiring, I remembered at the moment of waking that I had not told Harley about the romantic wedding of Captain Dan.',\n",
       " \" As I had left my friend in very ill humour I thought that this would be a good excuse for an early call, and just before eleven o'clock I walked into his office. Innes, his invaluable secretary, showed me into the study at the back.\",\n",
       " ' \"Hallo, Knox,\" said Harley, looking up from a little silver Buddha which he was examining, \"have you come to ask for news of the Kwen Lung case?\" \"No,\" I replied. \"Is there any?\" Harley shook his head.',\n",
       " ' \"It seems like fate,\" he declared, \"that this thing should have been sent to me this morning.\" He indicated the silver Buddha. \"A present from a friend who knows my weakness for Chinese ornaments,\" he explained grimly.',\n",
       " ' \"It reminds me of that damned joss of Kwen Lung\\'s!\" I took up the little image and examined it with interest. It was most beautifully fashioned in the patient Oriental way, and there was a little hinged door in the back which fitted so perfectly that when closed it was quite impossible to detect its presence.',\n",
       " ' I glanced at Harley. \"I suppose you didn\\'t find a jewel inside?\" I said lightly. \"No,\" he replied; \"there was nothing inside.\" But even as he uttered the words his whole expression changed, and so suddenly as to startle me.',\n",
       " ' He sprang up from the table, and: \"Have you an hour to spare, Knox?\" he cried excitedly. \"I can spare an hour, but what for?\" \"For Kwen Lung!\" Four minutes later we were speeding in the direction of Limehouse, and not a word of explanation to account for this sudden journey could I extract from my friend.',\n",
       " ' Therefore I beguiled the time by telling him of my adventure with Captain Dan. Harley listened to the story in unbroken silence, but at its termination he brought his hand down sharply on my knee. \"I have been almost perfectly blind, Knox,\" he said; \"but not quite so perfectly blind as you!\" I stared at him in amazement, but he merely laughed and offered no explanation of his words.',\n",
       " ' Presently, then, I found myself yet again in the familiar room of the golden joss. Ma Lorenzo, in whom some hidden anxiety seemed to have increased since I had last seen her, stood at the top of the stairs watching us.',\n",
       " ' Upon what idea my friend was operating and what he intended to do I could not imagine; but without a word to the woman he crossed the room and grasping the great golden idol with both arms he dragged it forward across the floor! As he did so there was a stifled shriek, and Ma Lorenzo, stumbling down the steps, threw herself on her knees before Harley! Raising imploring hands: \"No, no!\" she moaned.',\n",

       " ' The woman rose unsteadily and walking slowly round the joss manipulated some hidden fastening, whereupon the entire back of the thing opened like a door! From what was within she shudderingly averted her face, but Harley, stepping back against the wall, stopped and peered into the cavity.',\n",
       " ' \"Good God!\" he muttered. \"Come and look, Knox.\" Prepared by his manner for some gruesome spectacle, I obeyed—and from that which I saw I recoiled in horror. \"Harley,\" I whispered, \"Harley! who is it?\" The spectacle had truly sickened me.',\n",

       " ' \"He is vile, a demon, a mocking cruel demon! Long, long years ago I would have killed him, but always I was afraid. I tell you everything, everything. This is how he comes to be dead.

       " \" He does not know that someone comes to see her—someone who used to come to smoke but who gave it up because he had looked into the dear one's eye. He does not know that she goes with me to see her man.\",\n",
       " ' Ah! we think he does not know! I—I arrange it all. A week ago they were married. Tuesday night, when Kwen Lung die, I plan for her to steal away for ever, for ever.\" Tears now were running down the woman\\'s fat cheeks, and her voice quivered emotionally.',\n",
       " ' \"For me it is the end, but for her it is the beginning of life. All right! I don\\'t matter a damn! She is young and beautiful. Ah, God! so beautiful! A drunken pig comes here and finds his way in, so I give him the smoke and presently he sleeps, but it makes delay, and I don\\'t know how soon Kwen Lung, that yellow demon, will wake.',\n",
       " ' For he is like the bats who sleep all day and wake at night. \"At last the sailor pig sleeps and I call softly to my dear little one that the time has come. I have gone out into the street, locking the door behind me, to see if her man is waiting, and I hear her shrieks—her shrieks! I hurry back.',\n",
       " ' My hands tremble so much that I can scarcely unlock the door. At last I enter, and I see and I know—that yellow devil has learned all and has been playing with us like cat and mouse! He is lashing her, with a great whip! Lashing her—that tiny, sweet flower.',\n",
       " ' Ah!\" She choked in her utterance, and turning to the gilded joss which contained the dead Chinaman she shook her clenched hands at it, and the expression on her face I can never forget. Then: \"As I shriek curses at him, crash goes the window—and I see her husband spring into the room! The tender one had fallen, there at the foot of the joss, and Kwen Lung, his teeth gleaming—like a rat—like a devil—turns to meet him.',\n",
       " ' So he is when her man strike him, once. Just once, here.\" She rested her hand upon her heart. \"And he falls—and he coughs. He lie still. For him it is finished. That devil heart has ceased to beat. Ah!\" She threw up her hands, and: \"That is all.',\n",
       " ' I tell you no more.\" \"One thing more,\" said Harley sternly; \"the name of the man who killed Kwen Lung?\" At that Ma Lorenzo slowly raised her head and folded her arms across her bosom. There was something one could never forget in the expression of her fat face.',\n",
       " ' \"Not if you burn me alive!\" she answered in a low voice. \"No one ever knows that—from me.\" She sank on to the divan and buried her face in her hands. Her fat shoulders shook grotesquely; and Harley stood perfectly still staring across at her for fully a minute.',\n",
       " ' I could hear voices in the street outside and the hum of traffic in Limehouse Causeway. Then my friend did a singular thing. Walking over to the gilded joss he reclosed the opening and not without a great effort pushed the great idol back against the wall.',\n",
       " ' \"There are times, Knox,\" he said, staring at me oddly, \"when I\\'m glad that I am not an official agent of the law.\" While I watched him dumfounded he walked across to the woman and touched her on the shoulder.',\n",

       " '\" With never another word he seized me by the arm and hurried me out of the place! Ten paces along the street a shabby–looking fellow was standing, leaning against a pillar. Harley stopped, and: \"Even the greatest men make mistakes sometimes, Hewitt,\" he remarked.',\n",
       " ' \"I\\'m throwing up the case; probably Inspector Wessex will do the same. Good morning.\" On towards the Causeway he led me—for not a word was I capable of uttering; and just before we reached that artery of Chinatown, from down–river came the deep, sustained note of a steamer\\'s siren, the warning of some big liner leaving dock.',\n",

But the remarkable feature of his appearance lay in the fact that every scrap of hair from chin, lip, eyebrows and skull had been shaved off! There was another facial disfigurement, peculiarly and horribly Eastern, which my pen may not describe.',\n",
       " ' \"Impossible to identify!\" murmured Harley. \"Yes, you were right, Inspector; this is a victim of Oriental deviltry. Look here, too!\" He indicated three small wounds, one situated on the left shoulder and the others on the forearm of the dead man.',\n",
       " ' \"The divisional surgeon cannot account for them,\" replied Wessex. \"They are quite superficial, and he thinks they may be due to the fact that the body got entangled with something in the river.\" \"They are due to the fact that the man had a birthmark on his shoulder and something—probably a name or some device—tattooed on his arm,\" said Harley quietly.',\n",
       " ' \"Some few years ago, I met with a similar case in the neighbourhood of Stambul. A woman,\" he added, significantly. Detective–Inspector Wessex listened to my companion with respect, for apart from his established reputation as a private inquiry–agent which had made his name familiar in nearly every capital of the civilized world, Paul Harley\\'s work in Constantinople during the six months preceding war with Turkey had merited higher reward than it had ever received.',\n",
       " ' Had his recommendations been adopted the course of history must have been materially changed. \"You think it\\'s a Chinatown case, then, Mr. Harley?\" \"Possibly,\" was the guarded answer. Paul Harley nodded to the constable in charge, and the ghastly figure was promptly covered up again.',\n",
       " ' My friend stood staring vacantly at Wessex, and presently: \"The chief actor, I think, will prove to be not Chinese,\" he said, turned, and walked out. \"If there\\'s any development,\" remarked Wessex as the three of us entered Harley\\'s car, which stood at the door, \"I will, of course, report to you, Mr.',\n",

       " ' \"I made a special visit to Wapping just to get your opinion on the shaven man. I\\'m really going down to Deepbrow to look into that new disappearance case; the daughter of the gamekeeper. You\\'ll have read of it?\" \"I have,\" said Harley shortly.',\n",
       " ' Indeed, readers of the daily press were growing tired of seeing on the contents bills: \"Another girl missing.\" The circumstance (which might have been no more than coincidence) that three girls had disappeared within the last eight weeks leaving no trace behind, had stimulated the professional scribes to link the cases, although no visible link had been found, and to enliven a somewhat dull journalistic season with theories about \"a new Mormon menace.',\n",
       " '\" The vanishing of this fourth girl had inspired them to some startling headlines, and the case had interested me personally for the reason that I was acquainted with Sir Howard Hepwell, one of whose gamekeepers was the stepfather of the missing Molly Clayton.',\n",
       " \" Moreover, it was hinted that she had gone away in the company of Captain Ronald Vane, at that time a guest of Sir Howard's at the Manor. In fact, Sir Howard had 'phoned to ask me if I could induce Harley to run down, but my friend had expressed himself as disinterested in a common case of elopement.\",\n",
       " ' Now, as Wessex spoke, I glanced aside at Harley, wondering if the fact that so celebrated a member of the C.I.D. as Detective–Inspector Wessex had been put in charge would induce him to change his mind.',\n",
       " ' We were traversing a particularly noisy and unsavoury section of the Commercial Road, and although I could see that Wessex was anxious to impart particulars of the case to Harley, so loud was the din that I recognized the impossibility of conversing, and therefore: \"Have you time to call at my rooms, Wessex?\" I asked.',\n",
       " ' \"Well,\" he replied, \"I have three–quarters of an hour.\" \"You can do it in the car,\" said Harley suddenly. \"I have been asked to look into this case myself, and before I definitely decline I should like to hear your version of the matter.',\n",
       " '\" Accordingly, we three presently gathered in my chambers, and Wessex, with one eye on the clock, outlined the few facts at that time in his possession respecting the missing girl. Two days before the news of the disappearance had been published broadcast under such headings as I have already indicated, a significant scene had been enacted in the gamekeeper\\'s cottage.',\n",
       " ' Molly Clayton, a girl whose remarkable beauty had made her a central figure in numerous scandalous stories, for such is the charity of rural neighbours, was detected by her stepfather, about eight in the evening, slipping out of the cottage.',\n",
       " ' \"Where be ye goin\\', hussy?\" he demanded, grasping her promptly by the arm. \"For a walk!\" she replied defiantly. \"A walk wi\\' that fine soger from t\\' Manor!\" roared Bramber furiously. \"You\\'ll be sorry yet, you barefaced gadabout! Must I tell you again that t\\' man\\'s a villain?\" The girl wrenched her arm from Bramber\\'s grasp, and blazed defiance from her beautiful eyes.',\n",
       " ' \"He knows how to respect a woman—what you don\\'t!\" she retorted hotly. \"So I don\\'t respect you, my angel?\" shouted her stepfather. \"Then you know what you can do! The door\\'s open and there\\'s few\\'ll miss you!\" Snatching her hat, the girl, very white, made to go out.',\n",
       " ' Whereat the gamekeeper, a brutal man with small love for Molly, and maddened by her taking him at his word, seized her suddenly by her abundant fair hair and hauled her back into the room. A violent scene followed, at the end of which Molly fainted and Bramber came out and locked the door.',\n",
       " \" When he came back about half–past nine the girl was missing. She did not reappear that night, and the police were advised in the morning. Their most significant discovery was this: Captain Ronald Vane, on the night of Molly's disappearance, had left the Manor House, after dining alone with his host, Sir Howard Hepwell, saying that he proposed to take a stroll as far as the Deep Wood.\",\n",
       " ' He never returned! From the moment that Gamekeeper Bramber left his cottage, and the moment when Sir Howard Hepwell parted from his guest after dinner, the world to which these two people, Molly Clayton and Captain Vane, were known, knew them no more! I was about to say that they were never seen again.',\n",
       " ' But to me has fallen the task of relating how and where Paul Harley and I met with Captain Vane and Molly Clayton. At the end of the Inspector\\'s account: \"H\\'m,\" said Harley, glancing under his thick brows in my direction, \"could you spare the time, Knox?\" \"To go to Deepbrow?\" I asked with interest.',\n",
       " ' \"Yes; we have ten minutes to catch the train.\" \"I\\'ll come,\" said I. \"Sir Howard will be delighted to see you, Harley.\".',\n",

       " ' Harley!\" Harley bowed, smiling, at the implied compliment. \"It\\'s a common or garden elopement!\" continued the detective. \"Vane\\'s reputation is absolutely rotten, and the girl was clearly infatuated. He must have cared a good bit, too.',\n",
       " ' He\\'ll be cashiered, as sure as a gun!\" Leaving Sir Howard at the Manor, we had joined Inspector Wessex at a spot where the baronet\\'s preserves bordered a narrow lane. Here the ground was soft, and the detective drew Harley\\'s attention to a number of footprints by a stile.',\n",
       " ' \"I\\'ve got evidence that he was seen here with the girl on other occasions. Now, Mr. Harley, I\\'ll ask you to look over these footprints.\" Harley dropped to his knees and made a brief but close examination of the ground round about.',\n",
       " ' One particularly clear imprint of a pointed toe he noticed especially; and Wessex, diving into the pocket of his light overcoat, produced a patent–leather shoe, such as is used for evening wear. \"He had a spare pair in his bag,\" he explained nonchalantly, \"and his man did not prove incorruptible!\" Harley took the shoe and placed it in the impression.',\n",
       " ' It fitted perfectly! \"This is Molly Clayton, I take it?\" he said, indicating the prints of a woman\\'s foot. \"Yes,\" assented Wessex. \"You\\'ll notice that they stood for some little time and then walked off, very close together.',\n",
       " '\" Harley nodded absently. \"We lose them along here,\" continued Wessex, leading up the lane; \"but at the corner by the big haystack they join up with the tracks of a motor–car! I ask for nothing clearer! There was rain that afternoon, but there\\'s been none since.',\n",
       " '\" \"What does the Captain\\'s man think?\" \"The same as I do! He\\'s not surprised at any madness on Vane\\'s part, with a pretty woman in the case!\" \"The girl left nothing behind—no note?\" \"Nothing.\" \"Traced the car?\" \"No.',\n",
       " ' It must have been hired or borrowed from a long distance off.\" Where the tracks of the tires were visible we stopped, and Harley made a careful examination of the marks. \"Seems to have had a struggle with her,\" he said, dryly.',\n",
       " ' \"Very likely!\" agreed Wessex, without interest. Harley crawled about on the ground for some time, to the great detriment of his Harris tweeds, but finally arose, a curious expression on his face—which, however, the detective evidently failed to observe.',\n",
       " \" We returned to the Manor House where Sir Howard was awaiting us, his good–humoured red face more red than usual; and in the library, with its sporting prints and its works for the most part dealing with riding, hunting, racing, and golf (except for a sprinkling of Nat Gould's novels and some examples of the older workmanship of Whyte–Melville), we were presently comfortably ensconced.\",\n",
       " ' On a side table were placed a generous supply of liquid refreshments, cigars and cigarettes; so that we made ourselves quite comfortable, and Sir Howard restrained his indignation, until each had a glass before him and all were smoking.',\n",
       " ' \"Now,\" he began, \"what have you got to report, gentlemen? You, Inspector,\" he pointed with his cigar toward Wessex, \"have seen Vane\\'s man and all of you have been down to look at these damned tracks. I only want to hear one thing; that you expect to trace the disgraceful couple.',\n",
       " ' I\\'ll see to it\"—his voice rose almost to a shout—\"that Vane is kicked out of the service, and as to that shameless brat of Bramber\\'s, I wish her no worse than the blackguard\\'s company!\" \"One moment, Sir Howard, one moment,\" said Harley quietly; \"there are always two sides to a case.',\n",
       " '\" \"What do you mean, Mr. Harley? There\\'s only one side that interests me—the outrage inflicted upon my hospitality by this dirty guest of mine. For the girl I don\\'t give twopence; she was bound to come to a bad end.',\n",
       " '\" \"Well,\" said Harley, \"before we pronounce the final verdict upon either of them I should like to interview Bramber. Perhaps,\" he added, turning to Wessex, \"it would be as well if Mr. Knox and I went alone.',\n",
       " ' The presence of an official detective sometimes awes this class of witness.\" \"Quite right, quite right!\" agreed Sir Howard, waving his cigar vigorously. \"Go and see Bramber, Mr. Harley; tell him that no blame attaches to himself whatever; also, tell him with my compliments that his stepdaughter is―—\" \"Quite so, quite so,\" interrupted Harley, endeavouring to hide a smile.',\n",
       " ' \"I understand your feelings, Sir Howard, but again I ask you to reserve your verdict until all the facts are before us.\" As a result, Harley and I presently set out for the gamekeeper\\'s cottage, and as the man had been warned that we should visit him, he was on the porch smoking his pipe.',\n",
       " ' A big, dark, ugly fellow he proved to be, of a very forbidding cast of countenance. Having introduced ourselves: \"I always knowed she\\'d come to a bad end!\" declared Gamekeeper Bramber, almost echoing Sir Howard\\'s words.',\n",
       " ' \"One o\\' these gentlemen o\\' hers was sure to be the finish of her!\" \"She had other admirers—before Captain Vane?\" \"Aye! the hussy! There was a black–faced villain not six months since! He got t\\' vain cat to go to London an\\' have her photograph done in a dress any decent woman would \\'a\\' blushed to look at! Like one o\\' these Venuses up at t\\' Manor! Good riddance! She took after her mother!\" The violent old ruffian was awkward to examine, but Harley persevered.',\n",
       " ' \"This previous admirer caused her to be photographed in that way, did he? Have you a copy?\" \"No!\" blazed Bramber. \"What I found I burnt! He ran off, like I told her he would—an\\' her cryin\\' her eyes out! But the pretty soger dried her tears quick enough!\" \"Do you know this man\\'s name?\" \"No.',\n",
       " ' A foreigner, he was.\" \"Where were the photographs done—in London, you say?\" \"Aye.\" \"Do you know by what photographer?\" \"I don\\'t! An\\' I don\\'t care! Piccadilly they had on \\'em, which was good enough for me.',\n",
       " '\" \"Have you her picture?\" \"No!\" \"Did she receive a letter on the day of her disappearance?\" \"Maybe.\" \"Good day!\" said Harley. \"And let me add that the atmosphere of her home was hardly conducive to ideal conduct!\" Leaving Bramber to digest this rebuke, we came out of the cottage.',\n",
       " ' Dusk was falling now, and by the time that we regained the Manor the place was lighted up. Inspector Wessex was waiting for us in the library, and: \"Well?\" he said, smiling slightly as we entered. \"Nothing much,\" replied Harley dryly, \"except that I don\\'t wonder at the girl\\'s leaving such a home.',\n",
       " '\" \"What\\'s that! What!\" roared a big voice, and Sir Howard came into the room. \"I tell you, Bramber only had one fault as a stepfather; he wasn\\'t heavy–handed enough. A bad lot, sir, a bad lot!\" \"Well, sir,\" said Inspector Wessex, looking from one to another, \"personally, beyond the usual inquiries at railway stations, etc.',\n",
       " ', I cannot see that we can do much here. Don\\'t you agree with me, Mr. Harley?\" Harley nodded. \"Quite,\" he replied. \"There is a late train to town which I think we could catch if we started at once.\" \"Eh?\" roared Sir Howard; \"you\\'re not going back to–night? Your rooms are ready for you, damn it!\" \"I quite appreciate the kindness, Sir Howard,\" replied Harley; \"but I have urgent business to attend to in London.',\n",
       " ' Believe me, my departure is unavoidable.\" The blue eyes of the baronet gleamed with the simple cunning of his kind. \"You\\'ve got something up your sleeve,\" he roared. \"I know you have, I know you have!\" Inspector Wessex looked at me significantly, but I could only shrug my shoulders in reply; for in these moods Harley was as inscrutable as the Sphinx.',\n",
       " ' However, he had his way, and Sir Howard hurriedly putting a car in commission, we raced for the local station and just succeeded in picking up the express at Claybury. Wessex was rather silent throughout the journey, often glancing in my friend\\'s direction, but Harley made no further reference to the case beyond outlining the interview with Bramber, until, as we were parting at the London terminus, Wessex to report to Scotland Yard and I to go to Harley\\'s rooms: \"How long do you think it will take you to find that photographer, Wessex?\" he asked.',\n",
       " ' \"Piccadilly is a sufficient clue.\" \"Well,\" replied the Inspector, \"nothing can be done to–night, of course, but I should think by mid–day tomorrow the matter should be settled.\" \"Right,\" said Harley shortly.',\n",
       " ' \"May I ask you to report the result to me, Wessex?\" \"I will report without fail.\".',\n",
       " 'III: Ali of Cairo It was not until the evening of the following day that Harley rang me up, and: \"I want you to come round at once,\" he said urgently. \"The Deepbrow case is developing along lines which I confess I had anticipated, but which are dramatic nevertheless.',\n",
       " '\" Knowing that Harley did not lightly make such an assertion, I put aside the work upon which I was engaged and hurried around to Chancery Lane. I found my friend, pipe in mouth, walking up and down his smoke–laden study in a state which I knew to betoken suppressed excitement, and: \"Did Wessex find your photographer?\" I asked on entering.',\n",
       " ' \"Yes,\" he replied. \"A first–class man, as I had anticipated. As I had further anticipated he did a number of copies of the picture for the foreign gentleman—about fifty, in fact!\" \"Fifty!\" \"Yes! Does the significance of that fact strike you?\" asked Harley, a queer smile stealing across his tanned, clean–shaven face.',\n",
       " ' \"It is an extraordinary thing for even an ardent admirer to have so many reproductions done of the same picture!\" \"It is! I will show you now what I found trodden into one of the footprints where the struggle took place beside the car.',\n",
       " '\" Harley produced a piece of thick silk twine. \"What is it?\" \"It is a link, Knox—a link to seek which I really went down to Deepbrow.\" He stared at me quizzically, but my answering look must have been a blank one.',\n",
       " ' \"It is part of the tassel of one of those red cloth caps commonly called in England, a fez!\" He continued to stare at me and I to stare at the piece of silk; then: \"What is the next move?\" I demanded.',\n",
       " ' \"Your new clue rather bewilders me.\" \"The next move,\" he said, \"is to retire to the adjoining room and make ourselves look as much like a couple of Oriental commercial travellers as our correctly British appearance will allow!\" \"What!\" I cried.',\n",
       " ' \"That\\'s it!\" laughed Harley. \"I have a perpetual tan, and I think I can give you a temporary one which I keep in a bottle for the purpose.\" Twenty minutes later, then, having quitted Harley\\'s chambers by a back way opening into one of those old–world courts which abound in this part of the metropolis, two quietly attired Eastern gentlemen got into a cab at the corner of Chancery Lane and proceeded in the direction of Limehouse.',\n",
       " \" There are haunts in many parts of London whose very existence is unsuspected by all but the few; haunts unvisited by the tourist and even unknown to the copy–hunting pressman. Into a quiet thoroughfare not three minutes' walk from the busy life of West India Dock Road, Harley led the way.\",\n",
       " ' Before a door sandwiched in between the entrance to a Greek tobacconist\\'s establishment and a boarded shop–front, he paused and turned to me. \"Whatever you see or hear,\" he cautioned, \"express no surprise.',\n",
       " ' Above all, show no curiosity.\" He rang the bell beside the door, and almost immediately it was opened by a Negress, grossly and repellently ugly. Harley pattered something in what sounded like Arabic, whereat the Negress displayed the utmost servility, ushering us into an ill–lighted passage with every evidence of respect.',\n",
       " \" Following this passage to its termination, an inner door was opened, and a burst of discordant music greeted us, together with a wave of tobacco smoke. We entered. Despite my friend's particular injunctions to the contrary I gave a start of amazement.\",\n",
       " ' We stood in the doorway of a fairly large apartment having a divan round three of its sides. This divan was occupied by ten or a dozen men of mixed nationalities—Arabs, Greeks, lascars, and others. They smoked cigarettes for the most part and sipped Mokha from little cups.',\n",
       " ' A girl was performing a wriggling dance upon the square carpet occupying the centre of the floor, accompanied by a Nubian boy who twanged upon a guitar, and by most of the assembled company, who clapped their hands to the music or droned a low, tuneless dirge.',\n",
       " ' Shortly after our entrance the performance terminated, and the girl retired through a curtained doorway at the farther end of the room. Our presence being now observed, suspicious glances were cast in our direction, and a very aged man, who sat smoking a narghli near the door by which the girl had made her exit, gravely waved towards us the amber mouthpiece which he held in his hand.',\n",
       " \" Harley walked straight across to him, I close at his heels. The light of a lamp which hung close by fell fully upon my friend's face; and, rising from his seat, the old man greeted him with the dignified and graceful salutation of the East.\",\n",
       " \" At his request we seated ourselves beside him, and, while we all three smoked excellent Turkish cigarettes, Harley and he conversed in a low tone. Suddenly, at some remark of my friend's, our strange host rose to his feet, an angry frown contracting his heavy eyebrows.\",\n",
       " ' Silence fell upon the company. In a loud and peremptory voice he called out something in Arabic. Instantly I detected a fellow near the entrance door, and whom I had not hitherto observed, slipping furtively into the shadow, with a view, as I thought, to secret departure.',\n",
       " ' He seemed to be deformed in some way and had the most evil, pock–marked face I had ever beheld in my life. Angrily, the majestic old man recalled him. Whereupon, with a sort of animal snarl quite indescribable, the fellow plucked out a knife! Two men who had been on the point of seizing him fell back, and: \"Hold him!\" shouted Harley, springing forward—\"hold him! It\\'s Ali of Cairo!\" But Harley was too late.',\n",
       " ' Turning, the strange and formidable–looking Oriental ran like the wind! Ere hand could be raised to stay him he was through the doorway! \"That settles it,\" said Harley grimly, as once more I found myself in a cab beside him.',\n",
       " ' \"I was right; but he\\'ll forestall us!\" \"Who will forestall us?\" I asked in bewilderment. \"The biggest villain in Europe, Asia, or Africa!\" cried my companion. \"I have wasted precious time to–day. I might have known.',\n",
       " '\" He drummed irritably upon his knees. \"The place we have just left is a sort of club, you understand, Knox, and Hakim is the proprietor or host as well as being an old gentleman of importance and authority in the Moslem world.',\n",
       " ' I told him of my suspicions—which step I should have taken earlier—and they were instantly confirmed. My man was there—recognized me—and bolted! He\\'ll forestall us.\" \"But my dear fellow,\" I said patiently—\"who is this man, and what has he to do with the Deepbrow case?\" \"He is the blackest scoundrel breathing!\" answered Harley bitterly.',\n",
       " ' \"As to what he has to do with the case—why did he bolt? At any rate, I know where to find him now—and we may not be too late after all.\" \"But who and what is this man?\" \"He is Ali of Cairo! As to what he is—you will soon learn.',\n",
       " 'IV: The House by the River On quitting the singular Oriental club, Harley had first raced off to a public telephone, where he had spoken for some time—as I now divined—to Scotland Yard. For when we presently arrived at the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, I was surprised to find Inspector Wessex awaiting us.',\n",
       " ' Leaning out of the cab window: \"Yes?\" called Harley excitedly. \"Was I right?\" \"You were, Mr. Harley,\" answered Wessex, who seemed to be no less excited than my companion. \"I got the man\\'s reply an hour ago.',\n",
       " '\" \"I knew it!\" said Harley shortly. \"Get in, Wessex; we haven\\'t a minute to waste.\" The Inspector joined us in the cab, having first given instructions to the chauffeur. As we set out once more: \"You have had very little time to make the necessary arrangements,\" continued my friend.',\n",
       " ' \"Time enough,\" replied Wessex. \"They will not be expecting us.\" \"I\\'m not so sure of it. One of the biggest villains in the civilized world recognized me three minutes before I called you up and then made good his escape.',\n",
       " ' However, there is at least a fighting chance.\" Little more was said from that moment until the end of the drive, both my companions seeming to be consumed by an intense eagerness to reach our destination.',\n",
       " ' At last the cab drew up in a deserted street. I had rather lost my bearings; but I knew that we were once more somewhere in the Chinatown area, and: \"Follow us until we get into the house,\" Harley said to Inspector Wessex, \"and wait out of sight.',\n",
       " ' If you hear me blow this whistle, bring up the men you have posted—as quick as you like! But make it your particular business to see that no one gets out!\" Into a pitch–dark yard we turned, and I felt a shudder of apprehension upon observing that it was the entrance to a wharf.',\n",
       " ' Dully gleaming in the moonlight, the Thames, that grave of many a ghastly secret, flowed beneath us. Emerging from the shadow of the archway, we paused before a door in the wall on our left. At that moment something gleamed through the air, whizzed past my ear, and fell with a metallic jingle on the stones! Instinctively we both looked up.',\n",
       " ' At an unlighted window on the first floor I caught a fleeting glimpse of a dark face. \"You were right!\" I said. \"Ali of Cairo has forestalled us!\" Harley stooped and picked up a knife with a broad and very curious blade.',\n",
       " ' He slipped it into his pocket, nonchalantly. \"All evidence!\" he said. \"Keep in the shadow and bend down. I am going to stand on your shoulders and get into that window!\" Wondering at his daring, I nevertheless obeyed; and Harley succeeded, although not without difficulty, in achieving his purpose.',\n",
       " ' A moment after he had disappeared in the blackness of the room above. \"Stand clear, Knox!\" I heard. Two of the cushion seats sometimes called \"poof–ottomans\" were thrown down, and: \"Up you come!\" called Harley.',\n",
       " ' \"I\\'ll grasp your hands if you can reach.\" It proved no easy task, but I finally managed to scramble up beside my friend—to find myself in a dark and stuffy little room. \"This way!\" said Harley rapidly—\"upstairs.',\n",
       " '\" He led the way without more ado, but it was with serious misgivings that I stumbled up a darkened stair in the rear of my greatly daring friend. A pistol cracked in the darkness—and my fez was no longer on my head! Harley\\'s repeater answered, and we stumbled through a heavily curtained door into a heated room, the air of which was laden with some Eastern perfume.',\n",
       " \" In the dim light from a silken–shaded lantern a figure showed, momentarily, darting across the place before us. Again Harley's pistol spoke, but, as it seemed, ineffectively. I had little enough opportunity to survey my surroundings; yet even in those brief, breathless moments I saw enough of the place wherein we stood to make me doubt the evidence of my senses! Outside, I knew, lay a dingy wharf, amid a maze of mean streets; here was an opulently furnished apartment with a strong Oriental note in the decorations! Snatching an electric torch from his pocket, Harley leaped through a doorway draped with rich Persian tapestry, and I came close on his heels.\",\n",
       " ' Outside was darkness. A strong draught met us; and, passing along a carpeted corridor, we never halted until we came to a room filled with the weirdest odds and ends, apparently collected from every quarter of the globe.',\n",
       " ' Crack! A bullet flattened itself on the wall behind us! \"Good job he can\\'t shoot straight!\" rapped Harley. The ray of the torch suddenly picked out the head and shoulders of a man who was descending through a trap in the floor! Ere we had time to shoot he was gone! I saw his brown fingers relax their hold—and a bundle which he had evidently hoped to take with him was left lying upon the floor.',\n",
       " ' Together we ran to the trap and looked down. Slowly moving tidal water flowed darkly beneath us! For twenty breathless seconds we watched—but nothing showed upon the surface. \"I hope his swimming is no better than his shooting,\" I said.',\n",
       " ' \"It can avail him little,\" replied Harley grimly; \"a river–police boat is waiting for anyone who tries to escape from that side of the house. We are by no means alone in this affair, Knox. But, firstly, what have we here!\" He took up the bundle which the fugitive had deserted.',\n",
       " ' \"Something incriminating when Ali of Cairo dared not stay to face it out! He would never have deserted this place in the ordinary way. That fellow who was such a bad shot was left behind, when the news of our approach reached here, to make a desperate attempt to remove some piece of evidence! I\\'ll swear to it.',\n",
       " ' But we were too soon for him!\" All the time he was busily removing the pieces of sacking and scraps of Oriental stuff with which the bundle was fastened; and finally he drew out a dress–suit, together with the linen, collar, shoes, and underwear—a complete outfit, in fact—and on top of the whole was a soft gray felt hat! Eagerly Harley searched the garments for some name of a maker by which their owner might be identified.',\n",
       " ' Presently, inside the lining of the breast pocket, where such a mark is usually found, he discovered the label of a well–known West End firm. \"The police can confirm it, Knox!\" he said, looking up, his face slightly flushed with triumph; \"but I, personally, have no doubt!\" \"You may have no doubt, Harley,\" I retorted, \"but I am full of doubt! What is the significance of this discovery to which you seem to attach so much importance?\" \"At the moment,\" replied my friend, \"never mind; I still have hopes—although they have grown somewhat slender—of making a much more important discovery.',\n",
       " '\" \"Why not permit the police to aid in the search?\" \"The police are more useful in their present occupation,\" he replied. \"We are dealing with the most cunning knave produced by East or West, and I don\\'t mean to let him slip through my fingers if he is in this house! Nevertheless, Knox, I am submitting you to rather an appalling risk, I know; for our man is desperate, and if he is still in the place will prove as dangerous as a cornered rat.',\n",
       " '\" \"But the man who dropped through the trap?\" \"The man who dropped through the trap,\" said Harley, \"was not Ali of Cairo—and it is Ali of Cairo for whom I am looking!\" \"The hunchback we saw to–night?\" Harley nodded, and having listened intently for a few moments, proceeded again to search the singular apartments of the abode.',\n",
       " \" In each was evidence of Oriental occupancy; indeed, some of the rooms possessed a sort of Arabian Nights atmosphere. But no living creature was to be seen or heard anywhere. It was while the two of us, having examined every inch of wall, I should think, in the building, were standing staring rather blankly at each other in the room with the lighted lantern, that I saw Harley's expression change.\",\n",
       " ' \"Why,\" he muttered, \"is this one room illuminated—and all the others in darkness?\" Even then the significance of this circumstance was not apparent to me. But Harley stared critically at an electric switch which was placed on the immediate right of the door and then up at the silk–shaded lantern which lighted the room.',\n",
       " ' Crossing, he raised and lowered the switch rapidly, but the lamp continued to burn uninterruptedly! \"Ah!\" he said—\"a good trick!\" Grasping the wooden block to which the switch was attached, he turned it bodily—and I saw that it was a masked knob; for in the next moment he had pulled open the narrow section of wall—which proved to be nothing less than a cunningly fitted door! A small, dimly lighted apartment was revealed, the Oriental note still predominant in its appointments, which, however, were few, and which I scarcely paused to note.',\n",
       " ' For lying upon a mattress in this place was a pretty, fair–haired girl! She lay on her side, having one white arm thrown out and resting limply on the floor, and she seemed to be in a semi–conscious condition, for although her fine eyes were widely opened, they had a glassy, witless look, and she was evidently unaware of our presence.',\n",
       " ' \"Look at her pupils,\" rapped Harley. \"They have drugged her with bhang! Poor, pretty fool!\" \"Good God!\" I cried. \"Who is this, Harley?\" \"Molly Clayton!\" he answered. \"Thank heaven we have saved one victim from Ali of Cairo.',\n",
       " 'V: The Harem Agency Owing to the instrumentality of Paul Harley, the public never learned that the awful riverside murder called by the Press in reference to the victim\\'s shaven skull \"the barber atrocity\" had any relation to the Deepbrow case.',\n",
       " ' It was physically impossible to identify the victim, and Harley had his own reasons for concealing the truth. The house on the wharf with its choice Oriental furniture was seized by the police; but, strange to relate, no arrest was made in connection with this most gruesome outrage.',\n",
       " \" The man who dropped through the trap had been wounded by one of Harley's shots, and he sank for the last time under the very eyes of the crew of the police cutter. It was at a late hour on the night of this concluding tragedy that I learned the amazing truth underlying the case.\",\n",
       " ' Wessex was still at work in the East End upon the hundred and one formalities which attached to his office, and Harley and I sat in the study of my friend\\'s chambers in Chancery Lane. \"You see,\" Harley was explaining.',\n",
       " ' \"I got my first clue down at Deepbrow. The tracks leading to the motor–car. They showed—to anyone not hampered by a preconceived opinion—that the girl and Vane had not gone on together (since the man\\'s footprints proved him to have been running), but that she had gone first and that he had run after her! Arguments: (a) He heard the approach of the car; or (b) he heard her call for help.',\n",
       " ' In fact, it almost immediately became evident to me that someone else had met her at the end of the lane; probably someone who expected her, and whom she was going to meet when she, accidentally, encountered Vane! The captain was not attired for an elopement, and, more significant still, he said he should stroll to the Deep Wood, and that was where he did stroll to; for it borders the road at this point! \"I had privately ascertained, from the postman, that Molly Clayton actually received a letter on that morning! This resolved my last doubt.',\n",
       " ' She was not going to meet Vane on the night of her disappearance. \"Then whom?\" \"The old love! He who some months earlier had had over fifty seductive pictures of this undoubtedly pretty girl prepared for a purpose of his own!\" \"Vane interfered?\" \"When the girl saw that they meant to take her away, she no doubt made a fuss! He ran to the rescue! They had not reckoned on his being there, but these are clever villains, who leave no clues—except for one who has met them on their own ground!\" \"On their own ground! What do you mean, Harley? Who are these people?\" \"Well—where do you suppose those fifty photographs went?\" \"I cannot conjecture!\" \"Then I will tell you.',\n",
       " ' The turmoil in the East has put wealth and power into unscrupulous hands. But even before the war there were marts, Knox—open marts—at which a Negro girl might be purchased for some 30 pounds, and a Circassian for anything from 250 pounds to 500 pounds! Ah! You stare! But I assure you it was so.',\n",
       " ' Here is the point, though: there were, and still are, private dealers! Those photographs were circulated among the nouveaux riches of the East! They were employed in the same way that any other merchant employs a catalogue.',\n",
       " \" They reached the hands of many an opulent and abandoned 'profiteer' of Damascus, Stambul—where you will. Molly's picture would be one of many. Remember that hundreds of pretty girls disappear from their homes—taking the whole of the world—every year.\",\n",
       " ' Clearly, English beauty is popular at the moment! And,\" he added bitterly, \"the arch–villain has escaped!\" \"Ali of Cairo!\" I cried. \"Then Ali of Cairo―—\" \"Is the biggest slave–dealer in the East!\" \"Good God! Harley—at last I understand!\" \"I was slow enough to understand it myself, Knox.',\n",
       " ' But once the theory presented itself I asked Wessex to get into immediate touch with the valet he had already interviewed at Deepbrow. It was the result of his inquiry to which he referred when we met him at Scotland Yard to–night.',\n",

       " 'The White HatI: Major Jack Ragstaff \"Hallo! Innes,\" said Paul Harley as his secretary entered. \"Someone is making a devil of a row outside.\" \"This is the offender, Mr. Harley,\" said Innes, and handed my friend a visiting card.',\n",
       " ' Glancing at the card, Harley read aloud: \"Major J. E. P. Ragstaff, Cavalry Club.\" Meanwhile a loud harsh voice, which would have been audible in a full gale, was roaring in the lobby. \"Nonsense!\" I could hear the Major shouting.',\n",
       " ' \"Balderdash! There\\'s more fuss than if I had asked for an interview with the Prime Minister. Piffle! Balderdash!\" Innes\\'s smile developed into a laugh, in which Harley joined, then: \"Admit the Major,\" he said.',\n",
       " ' Into the study where Harley and I had been seated quietly smoking, there presently strode a very choleric Anglo–Indian. He wore a horsy check suit and white spats, and his tie closely resembled a stock.',\n",
       " ' In his hand he carried a heavy malacca cane, gloves, and one of those tall, light–gray hats commonly termed white. He was below medium height, slim and wiry; his gait and the shape of his legs, his build, all proclaimed the dragoon.',\n",
       " ' His complexion was purple, and the large white teeth visible beneath a bristling gray moustache added to the natural ferocity of his appearance. Standing just within the doorway: \"Mr. Paul Harley?\" he shouted.',\n",
       " ' It was apparently an inquiry, but it sounded like a reprimand. My friend, standing before the fireplace, his hands in his pockets and his pipe in his mouth, nodded brusquely. \"I am Paul Harley,\" he said.',\n",
       " ' \"Won\\'t you sit down?\" Major Ragstaff, glancing angrily at Innes as the latter left the study, tossed his stick and gloves on to a settee, and drawing up a chair seated himself stiffly upon it as though he were in a saddle.',\n",
       " ' He stared straight at Harley, and: \"You are not the sort of person I expected, sir,\" he declared. \"May I ask if it is your custom to keep clients dancin\\' on the mat and all that—on the blasted mat, sir?\" Harley suppressed a smile, and I hastily reached for my cigarette–case which I had placed upon the mantelshelf.',\n",
       " ' \"I am always naturally pleased to see clients, Major Ragstaff,\" said Harley, \"but a certain amount of routine is necessary even in civilian life. You had not advised me of your visit, and it is contrary to my custom to discuss business after five o\\'clock.',\n",
       " '\" As Harley spoke the Major glared at him continuously, and then: \"I\\'ve seen you in India!\" he roared; \"damme! I\\'ve seen you in India!—and, yes! in Turkey! Ha! I\\'ve got you now sir!\" He sprang to his feet.',\n",
       " ' \"You\\'re the Harley who was in Constantinople in 1912.\" \"Quite true.\" \"Then I\\'ve come to the wrong shop.\" \"That remains to be seen, Major.\" \"But I was told you were a private detective, and all that.\" \"So I am,\" said Harley quietly.',\n",
       " ' \"In 1912 the Foreign Office was my client. I am now at the service of anyone who cares to employ me.\" \"Hell!\" said the Major. He seemed to be temporarily stricken speechless by the discovery that a man who had acted for the British Government should be capable of stooping to the work of a private inquiry agent.',\n",
       " ' Staring all about the room with a sort of naive wonderment, he drew out a big silk handkerchief and loudly blew his nose, all the time eyeing Harley questioningly. Replacing his handkerchief he directed his regard upon me, and: \"This is my friend, Mr.',\n",
       " ' Knox,\" said Harley; \"you may state your case before him without hesitation, unless―—\" I rose to depart, but: \"Sit down, Mr. Knox! Sit down, sir!\" shouted the Major. \"I have no dirty linen to wash, no skeletons in the cupboard or piffle of that kind.',\n",
       " ' I simply want something explained which I am too thick–headed—too damned thick–headed, sir—to explain myself.\" He resumed his seat, and taking out his wallet extracted from it a small newspaper cutting which he offered to Harley.',\n",
       " ' \"Read that, Mr. Harley,\" he directed. \"Read it aloud.\" Harley read as follows: \"Before Mr. Smith, at Marlborough Street Police Court, John Edward Bampton was charged with assaulting a well–known clubman in Bond Street on Wednesday evening.',\n",
       " ' It was proved by the constable who made the arrest that robbery had not been the motive of the assault, and Bampton confessed that he bore no grudge against the assailed man, indeed, that he had never seen him before.',\n",
       " \" He pleaded intoxication, and the police surgeon testified that although not actually intoxicated, his breath had smelled strongly of liquor at the time of his arrest. Bampton's employers testified to a hitherto blameless character, and as the charge was not pressed the man was dismissed with a caution.\",\n",
       " '\" Having read the paragraph, Harley glanced at the Major with a puzzled expression. \"The point of this quite escapes me,\" he confessed. \"Is that so?\" said Major Ragstaff. \"Is that so, sir? Perhaps you will be good enough to read this.',\n",
       " '\" From his wallet he took a second newspaper cutting, smaller than the first, and gummed to a sheet of club notepaper. Harley took it and read as follows: \"Mr. De Lana, a well–known member of the Stock Exchange, who met with a serious accident recently, is still in a precarious condition.',\n",
       " '\" The puzzled look on Harley\\'s face grew more acute, and the Major watched him with an expression which I can only describe as one of fierce enjoyment. \"You\\'re thinkin\\' I\\'m a damned old fool, ain\\'t you?\" he shouted suddenly.',\n",
       " ' \"Scarcely that,\" said Harley, smiling slightly, \"but the significance of these paragraphs is not apparent, I must confess. The man Bampton would not appear to be an interesting character, and since no great damage has been done, his drunken frolic hardly comes within my sphere.',\n",
       " ' Of Mr. De Lana, of the Stock Exchange, I never heard, unless he happens to be a member of the firm of De Lana and Day?\" \"He\\'s not a member of that firm, sir,\" shouted the Major. \"He was, up to six o\\'clock this evenin\\'.',\n",
       " '\" \"What do you mean exactly?\" inquired Harley, and the tone of his voice suggested that he was beginning to entertain doubts of the Major\\'s sanity or sobriety; then: \"He\\'s dead!\" declared the latter. \"Dead as the Begum of Bangalore! He died at six o\\'clock.',\n",
       " ' I\\'ve just spoken to his widow on the telephone.\" I suppose I must have been staring very hard at the speaker, and certainly Harley was doing so, for suddenly directing his fierce gaze toward me: \"You\\'re completely treed, sir, and so\\'s your friend!\" shouted Major Ragstaff.',\n",
       " ' \"I confess it,\" replied Harley quietly; \"and since my time is of some little value I would suggest, without disrespect, that you explain the connection, if any, between yourself, the drunken Bampton, and Mr.',\n",
       " ' De Lana, of the Stock Exchange, who died, you inform us, at six o\\'clock this evening as the result, presumably, of injuries received in an accident.\" \"That\\'s what I\\'m here for!\" cried Major Ragstaff. \"In the first place, then, I am the party, although I saw to it that my name was kept out of print, whom the drunken lunatic assaulted.',\n",
       " '\" Harley, pipe in hand, stared at the speaker perplexedly. \"Understand me,\" continued the Major, \"I am the person—I, Jack Ragstaff—he assaulted. I was walkin\\' down from my quarters in Maddox Street on my way to dine at the club, same as I do every night o\\' my life, when this flamin\\' idiot sprang upon me, grabbed my hat\"—he took up his white hat to illustrate what had occurred—\"not this one, but one like it—pitched it on the ground and jumped on it!\" Harley was quite unable to conceal his smiles as the excited old soldier dropped his conspicuous head–gear on the floor and indulged in a vigorous pantomime designed to illustrate his statement.',\n",
       " ' \"Most extraordinary,\" said Harley. \"What did you do?\" \"What did I do?\" roared the Major. \"I gave him a crack on the head with my cane, and I said things to him which couldn\\'t be repeated in court. I punched him, and likewise hoofed him, but the hat was completely done in.',\n",
       " \" Damn crowd collected, hearin' me swearin' and bellowin'. Police and all that; names an' addresses and all that balderdash. Man lugged away to guard–room and me turnin' up at the club with no hat. Damn ridiculous spectacle at my time of life.\",\n",
       " '\" \"Quite so,\" said Harley soothingly; \"I appreciate your annoyance, but I am utterly at a loss to understand why you have come here, and what all this has to do with Mr. De Lana, of the Stock Exchange.',\n",
       " '\" \"He fell out of the window!\" shouted the Major. \"Fell out of a window?\" \"Out of a window, sir, a second floor window ten yards up a side street! Pitched on his skull—marvel he wasn\\'t killed outright!\" A faint expression of interest began to creep into Harley\\'s glance, and: \"I understand you to mean, Major Ragstaff,\" he said deliberately, \"that while your struggle with the drunken man was in progress Mr.',\n",
       " ' De Lana fell out of a neighbouring window into the street?\" \"Right!\" shouted the Major. \"Right, sir!\" \"Do you know this Mr. De Lana?\" \"Never heard of him in my life until the accident occurred. Seems to me the poor devil leaned out to see the fun and overbalanced.',\n",
       " ' Felt responsible, only natural, and made inquiries. He died at six o\\'clock this evenin\\', sir.\" \"H\\'m,\" said Harley reflectively. \"I still fail to see where I come in. From what window did he fall?\" \"Window above a sort of teashop, called Cafe Dame—damn silly name.',\n",
       " ' Place on a corner. Don\\'t know name of side street.\" \"H\\'m. You don\\'t think he was pushed out, for instance?\" \"Certainly not!\" shouted the Major; \"he just fell out, but the point is, he\\'s dead!\" \"My dear sir,\" said Harley patiently, \"I don\\'t dispute that point; but what on earth do you want of me?\" \"I don\\'t know what I want!\" roared the Major, beginning to walk up and down the room, \"but I know I ain\\'t satisfied, not easy in my mind, sir.',\n",
       " ' I wake up of a night hearin\\' the poor devil\\'s yell as he crashed on the pavement. That\\'s all wrong. I\\'ve heard hundreds of death–yells, but\"—he took up his malacca cane and beat it loudly on the table—\"I haven\\'t woke up of a night dreamin\\' I heard \\'em again.',\n",
       " '\" \"In a word, you suspect foul play?\" \"I don\\'t suspect anything!\" cried the other excitedly, \"but someone mentioned your name to me at the club—said you could see through concrete, and all that—and here I am.',\n",
       " ' There\\'s something wrong, radically wrong. Find out what it is and send the bill to me. Then perhaps I\\'ll be able to sleep in peace.\" He paused, and again taking out the large silk handkerchief blew his nose loudly.',\n",
       " ' Harley glanced at me in rather an odd way, and then: \"There will be no bill, Major Ragstaff,\" he said; \"but if I can see any possible line of inquiry I will pursue it and report the result to you.\".',\n",
       " 'II: A Curious Outrage \"What do you make of it, Harley?\" I asked. Paul Harley returned a work of reference to its shelf and stood staring absently across the study. \"Our late visitor\\'s history does not help us much,\" he replied.',\n",

       " ' No, I shall remember it. Many thanks. Good–bye.\" He turned to me. \"I suggest, Knox,\" he said, \"that we make our call and then proceed to dinner as arranged.\" Since I was always glad of an opportunity of studying my friend\\'s methods I immediately agreed, and ere long, leaving the lights of the two big hotels behind, our cab was gliding down the long slope which leads to Waterloo Station.',\n",
